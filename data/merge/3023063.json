Migrations, for example, do not get the caching benefit.\r\n\r\nAnd this would be a performance improvement for anyone.\r\n\r\nOne possibility is the adapters could override with their own, database-dependent way of determining whether a table exists. That would preserve the performance improvement but allow you to avoid swallowing errors (which _is_ ugly).\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52383084bd3543c15100f668"}, "issue_id": 3867, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3023063", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3867#issuecomment-3023063", "updated_at": "2011-12-05T20:47:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest", "login": "jadeforrest", "gravatar_id": "f4f2aaf70e80b1df127ceeb88bb71905", "html_url": "https://github.com/jadeforrest", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f4f2aaf70e80b1df127ceeb88bb71905?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe64b59fdac91e05c2c2e8a8cb0933f0b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 167022, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-05T20:47:37Z", "id": 3023063, "owner": "rails"}
