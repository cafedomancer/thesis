{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5345", "repo": "rails", "body": "@jeremy Array is sliceable because it is Enumerable. String is not Enumerable, but conceptually it's just a list of characters, so it's still a simple data structure. An AR model is a mix of simple data structure and arbitrarily complex behavior. For me, \"Slice off a bit of the model\" doesn't mean anything unless I'm thinking of \"the model\" as a data structure, at which point I want the other `Enumerable` methods as well so I can pass an AR model to any method that operates a map.\r\n\r\nI think this would be awesome, btw, if out of scope for this pull request.
