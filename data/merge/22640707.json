{"body": "Yeah, there is no good solution I am afraid.\r\n\r\nSome guides are more detailed, the most extreme one is the Active Support guide that not only documents at the API level, but it is more informative than the API itself for some methods (motivation is to provide a central point to read about extensions to core classes).\r\n\r\nThis guide has also a section where helpers are listed... gray area.\r\n\r\nIn general I believe we should avoid duplication.
