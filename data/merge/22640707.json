Find a balanced point and at most cross-link (\"read the API documentation for further details\", something like that). Which reminds me that I need to figure out a way to cross-link.\r\n\r\nThe patch is fine for me though, no reason strong enough not to apply.", "_id": {"$oid": "523c66d8bd354364b9000a78"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11617#issuecomment-22640707"}
