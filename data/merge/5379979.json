But as far as I could see, at each render call it'll be called at most twice now, in all different paths - one for `find_partial`, and other when rendering the layout, in case there's one. In case you think it's still required to do that, I'd like to do as a separate step - together with [this refactoring](https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva/rails/compare/partial-layout-collection-item...render-partial-refactor).\r\n\r\nThanks.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381041bd3543c15100d634"}, "issue_id": 6006, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5379979", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6006#issuecomment-5379979", "updated_at": "2012-04-27T11:56:21Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-27T11:55:56Z", "id": 5379979, "owner": "rails"}
