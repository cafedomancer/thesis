But as far as I could see, at each render call it'll be called at most twice now, in all different paths - one for `find_partial`, and other when rendering the layout, in case there's one. In case you think it's still required to do that, I'd like to do as a separate step - together with [this refactoring](https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva/rails/compare/partial-layout-collection-item...render-partial-refactor).\r\n\r\nThanks.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381041bd3543c15100d634"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6006#issuecomment-5379979"}
