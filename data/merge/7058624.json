I have merged this but when writing the changelog. The correct way to invoke the generator today is:\n\n        rails g migration create_join_table_for_artists_and_musics artists musics\n\nHowever, I realized that a user may also write this:\n\n        rails g migration create_join_table_for_artists_and_musics artist_id music_id\n\nSince we are expecting the attributes, it makes sense. Maybe we could add a method called `pluralized_name` to the generated attribute and then support both invocation syntax... I would honestly prefer the second one.\n\nCould you work on it too @lexmag ? Thanks a lot.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e1096bd354364b900cf39"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7028#issuecomment-7058624"}
