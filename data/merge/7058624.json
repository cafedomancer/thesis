{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7028", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks! I have merged this but when writing the changelog. The correct way to invoke the generator today is:\n\n        rails g migration create_join_table_for_artists_and_musics artists musics\n\nHowever, I realized that a user may also write this:\n\n        rails g migration create_join_table_for_artists_and_musics artist_id music_id\n\nSince we are expecting the attributes, it makes sense. Maybe we could add a method called `pluralized_name` to the generated attribute and then support both invocation syntax... I would honestly prefer the second one.\n\nCould you work on it too @lexmag ?
