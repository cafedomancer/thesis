When you do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rails generate scaffold LineItems product:references cart:belongs_to\r\n```\r\n\r\nRails generates a controller test that depends on fixtures, but that file cannot stand on it's own.  It depends on fixtures, but does not load them.  Someone writing their own controller test can choose whether or not to load fixtures, but as long as we're generating a controller test that **depends** on fixtures, shouldn't that file be able to run on it's own?", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5a22bd354364b9006094"}, "issue_id": 9080, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/15214306", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9080#issuecomment-15214306", "updated_at": "2013-03-21T01:19:22Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "login": "tenderlove", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-21T01:19:22Z", "id": 15214306, "owner": "rails"}
