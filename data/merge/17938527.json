{"body": "@charliesome Some it cannot parse because its architecture fundamentally doesn't support.  E.g., docs of certain sizes will blow out memory in `json` but work with a very reasonable footprint in `yajl`.  And `json` has deliberately hard-coded a depth limit in nested structures.  I'd imagine that was done as a stop-gap to blowing out memory, but it's not an accidental bug.
