E.g., docs of certain sizes will blow out memory in `json` but work with a very reasonable footprint in `yajl`.  And `json` has deliberately hard-coded a depth limit in nested structures.  I'd imagine that was done as a stop-gap to blowing out memory, but it's not an accidental bug.  The error message very clearly tells you it will not parse that document (see: https://github.com/flori/json/blob/master/lib/json/common.rb#L119).\r\n\r\nThat aside, even if it could subsume all other JSON processors in some future release, then you'd have to require a version not bundled with stdlib anyway, kinda negating the purported benefit of this being bundled in stdlib.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dd7ebd3543c151008b00"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10576#issuecomment-17938527"}
