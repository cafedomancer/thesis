E.g., docs of certain sizes will blow out memory in `json` but work with a very reasonable footprint in `yajl`.  And `json` has deliberately hard-coded a depth limit in nested structures.  I'd imagine that was done as a stop-gap to blowing out memory, but it's not an accidental bug.  The error message very clearly tells you it will not parse that document (see: https://github.com/flori/json/blob/master/lib/json/common.rb#L119).\r\n\r\nThat aside, even if it could subsume all other JSON processors in some future release, then you'd have to require a version not bundled with stdlib anyway, kinda negating the purported benefit of this being bundled in stdlib.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dd7ebd3543c151008b00"}, "issue_id": 10576, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17938527", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10576#issuecomment-17938527", "updated_at": "2013-05-15T13:34:56Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum", "login": "nirvdrum", "gravatar_id": "0f2cc1aefa9529ba8627270cf81d2160", "html_url": "https://github.com/nirvdrum", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/0f2cc1aefa9529ba8627270cf81d2160?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F5cba6e74e996a4b1d7534b6bdc8ee5f6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 12584, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-15T13:34:56Z", "id": 17938527, "owner": "rails"}
