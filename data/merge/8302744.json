(Thus, a string value in a `store_accessor` attribute that is set to 'No' will test as false, despite not being blank)\n\nThere's also a glaring bug in that code:\n\nhttps://github.com/hube/rails/commit/ba9d940713dfb8c9ea84acf8b085bb733cb64d5d#L0R27\n\nThat references `attr_name`, which isn't even in scope since the method body was moved!\n\nI'd say the question-mark accessor is a minor part of this; it's more about the incoming type-conversion to boolean, which could probably make good use of `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::Column::FALSE_VALUES`.", "_id": {"$oid": "523de4cebd354364b900b186"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7524#issuecomment-8302744"}
