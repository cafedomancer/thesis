(Thus, a string value in a `store_accessor` attribute that is set to 'No' will test as false, despite not being blank)\n\nThere's also a glaring bug in that code:\n\nhttps://github.com/hube/rails/commit/ba9d940713dfb8c9ea84acf8b085bb733cb64d5d#L0R27\n\nThat references `attr_name`, which isn't even in scope since the method body was moved!\n\nI'd say the question-mark accessor is a minor part of this; it's more about the incoming type-conversion to boolean, which could probably make good use of `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::Column::FALSE_VALUES`.", "_id": {"$oid": "523de4cebd354364b900b186"}, "issue_id": 7524, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8302744", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7524#issuecomment-8302744", "updated_at": "2012-09-05T15:27:50Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr", "login": "al2o3cr", "gravatar_id": "6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243", "html_url": "https://github.com/al2o3cr", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb20bb95ab626d93fd976af958fbc61ba.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1191, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-05T15:27:50Z", "id": 8302744, "owner": "rails"}
