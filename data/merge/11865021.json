This feature is still in the current release of 1.3.2 which as far as I know is published from https://github.com/josh/rack-ssl/commits/master where there hasn't been any substantive commits in years, and no mention of deprecation of this feature anywhere I can see.  Is there another repo somewhere?  Discussion of the reasoning for this?\r\n\r\nSeems to me rack-ssl serves two extremely important purposes: doing redirects and adding SSL headers.  This change seems to cut off the utility of the middleware for anyone who doesn't want SSL everywhere and force them to duplicate the header functionality which is pretty much boilerplate that Rails should be able to take care of easily.", "_id": {"$oid": "523816ecbd3543c15100df0e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5515#issuecomment-11865021"}
