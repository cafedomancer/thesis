It occurs when you use a `rename_index` with the new \"change\" method instead of \"up/down\" in migrations, which is now the default when generating a model for instance.\r\n\r\nWhen you run a `rake db:migrate`, everything's ok since `rename_index` runs in \"normal\" mode. But when you want to revert your migration with `rake db:rollback` or `rake db:migrate VERSION=0` for instance, the arguments are not in the correct order for the inverted `rename_index`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% RAILS_ENV=production rake db:create db:migrate db:rollback\r\n[...]\r\n==  RenameIndexOnPostTitle: migrating =========================================\r\n-- rename_index(:posts, \"index_on_posts_title\", \"idx_posts_title\")\r\n   -> 0.0954s\r\n==  RenameIndexOnPostTitle: migrated (0.0959s) ================================\r\n==  RenameIndexOnPostTitle: reverting =========================================\r\n-- rename_index(\"idx_posts_title\", \"index_on_posts_title\", \"posts\")\r\nrake aborted!\r\nAn error has occurred, all later migrations canceled:\r\nMysql2::Error: Table 'railspr2716.idx_posts_title' doesn't exist: SHOW KEYS FROM `idx_posts_title`\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to reproduce easily, I created a temporary repository with instructions in the README to see the problem : https://github.com/jbbarth/rails-pull-request-2716\r\n\r\n**NB**: the bug is much more visible on mysql than sqlite, because it seems that the sqlite adapter silently fails when a rename index fails.", "_id": {"$oid": "523840dcbd3543c151010942"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2716#issuecomment-1927746"}
