Therefore, I propose to provide two methods:\n\n    read_store_attribute(store, key)\n    write_store_attribute(store, key)\n\nSimilarly to the existing read_attribute and write_attribute. This way, you can override the writer for any attribute to behave as you wish:\n\n    def some_boolean=(value)\n      write_store_attribute(:store, :some_boolean, !!value)\n    end\n\nThis should solve your problem while cleaning up the existing code.", "_id": {"$oid": "523de4cfbd354364b900b18a"}, "issue_id": 7524, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8314137", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7524#issuecomment-8314137", "updated_at": "2012-09-05T21:15:00Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-05T21:15:00Z", "id": 8314137, "owner": "rails"}
