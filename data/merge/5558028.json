{"body": "@fxn I rewrote examples for `String#truncate`\r\n\r\nAbout `Time.now` and `Time.current` - you right, if there set time zone, `Time.now.advance` will be different with time extensions for `Numeric`, because they use `::Time.current` which returns TimeWithZone object. I rewrote calls to `Time.new` to `Time.current` in guides and Numeric docs.\r\n\r\nAbout wrong API - I just took these docs from Numeric extensions file: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L6 and checked before making this pull request. Also tests passed with this API.\r\n\r\nAbout `Range#===` I created gist which explains why this warning should be deleted or new alias should be added as I wrote to @vijaydev: https://gist.github.com/2629683", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5558028", "created_at": "2012-05-07T19:08:10Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6064#issuecomment-5558028", "updated_at": "2012-05-07T19:08:10Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6064, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gazay/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gazay/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gazay/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gazay", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gazay/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/gazay", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gazay/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d52cc558a29696bb722492259f3f52de?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F992b8175dd647e8e187e7cc2e0572623.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gazay/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gazay/received_events", "gravatar_id": "d52cc558a29696bb722492259f3f52de", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gazay/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "gazay", "type": "User", "id": 29658, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gazay/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e8a72bd354364b9010ade"}, "id": 5558028, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6064"}
