I rewrote calls to `Time.new` to `Time.current` in guides and Numeric docs.\r\n\r\nAbout wrong API - I just took these docs from Numeric extensions file: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/numeric/time.rb#L6 and checked before making this pull request. Also tests passed with this API.\r\n\r\nAbout `Range#===` I created gist which explains why this warning should be deleted or new alias should be added as I wrote to @vijaydev: https://gist.github.com/2629683", "_id": {"$oid": "523e8a72bd354364b9010ade"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6064#issuecomment-5558028"}
