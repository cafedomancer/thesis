I do not have SQLServer or Firebird database environments, it should mute deprecate messages for these adapters also.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant to say was this deprecate message should appear when Oracle, Firebird and SQLServer adapters are tested. but it should not appear when bundled adapters (sqlite3, mysql, mysql2 and postgresql) are tested.\r\n\r\nI was trying to make a fixusing `current_adapter?` but actually these tests use `Mocha::Mock` adapter, then made [a commit] (https://github.com/yahonda/rails/commit/beff312e2cf041090000aa98750b324e3b2a865a)  using if adapter names are defined or not.\r\n\r\nHere are both outputs.\r\n`rake test_oracle` [output] (https://gist.github.com/yahonda/5285473) and `rake test` [output] (https://gist.github.com/yahonda/5285437)\r\n\r\nThis output is what I expected whatever the way it is implemented.
