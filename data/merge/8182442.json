You are doing the FSM's work here. \n\nI don't know if JSONP and CORS are out of scope, but having run into problems with cross-origin ajax requests over the last two days, it is something I could've used a hint about. (Still can't figure out why respond_with doesn't seem to work with rack/cors)\n\nAlso, a clear list of what the callback events are and how to use them - I couldn't seem to get a handler bound to :failure, and wound up binding to ;error instead.\n\nI'm on a plane to PDX tomorrow AM, so I'll give this some thought when I'm in the air, and I'm sure to think of other stuff I had to google for. \n\nThanks again!\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523de79dbd354364b900b395"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7493#issuecomment-8182442"}
