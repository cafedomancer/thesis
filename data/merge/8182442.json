{"body": "First, let me say thanks for doing this. You are doing the FSM's work here. \n\nI don't know if JSONP and CORS are out of scope, but having run into problems with cross-origin ajax requests over the last two days, it is something I could've used a hint about. (Still can't figure out why respond_with doesn't seem to work with rack/cors)\n\nAlso, a clear list of what the callback events are and how to use them - I couldn't seem to get a handler bound to :failure, and wound up binding to ;error instead.\n\nI'm on a plane to PDX tomorrow AM, so I'll give this some thought when I'm in the air, and I'm sure to think of other stuff I had to google for. \n\nThanks again!\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8182442", "created_at": "2012-08-31T04:35:38Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7493#issuecomment-8182442", "updated_at": "2012-08-31T04:35:38Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7493, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattvanhorn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattvanhorn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattvanhorn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattvanhorn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattvanhorn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/mattvanhorn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattvanhorn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/985ff04dc441ad87b0cefcd31823575d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F331715f2fe524ed42a3f58aabf89f08e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattvanhorn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattvanhorn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "985ff04dc441ad87b0cefcd31823575d", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattvanhorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "mattvanhorn", "type": "User", "id": 20461, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattvanhorn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523de79dbd354364b900b395"}, "id": 8182442, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7493"}
