{"body": "Just found this issue, as I was noticing some odd session behavior with 3.2.8 this evening. \nI haven't studied this, but since this is being actively looked at, I wanted to share the two issues I'm seeing:\n1. For new sessions, in order to access `session[:session_id]`, `load_for_write!` must be called first. \nThis may be intentional, since if the session is empty, simply attempting to read a key value may not warrant a load.\n2. If reset_session is called, session returns a Hash - not a Rack::Session::Abstract::SessionHash. \nNot sure about this, but it does prevent using a write operation against the session in order to discover the new session id.\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8219468", "created_at": "2012-09-02T06:44:33Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7495#issuecomment-8219468", "updated_at": "2012-09-02T06:44:33Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7495, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/burns/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/burns/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/burns/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/burns", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/burns/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/burns", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/burns/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/dc03efb58652b74e28722beb5d5c1826?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6229c8950a89834489d855c14d32576f.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/burns/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/burns/received_events", "gravatar_id": "dc03efb58652b74e28722beb5d5c1826", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/burns/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "burns", "type": "User", "id": 198303, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/burns/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fb04bd3543c15100b730"}, "id": 8219468, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7495"}
