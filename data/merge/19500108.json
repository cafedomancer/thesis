{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10828", "repo": "rails", "body": "@robin850 fixed and rebased\r\n\r\n@senny @rafaelfranca thanks for the feedback! My original thought was that being more explicit about the type of exception can only improve the error. Simply, it's just better information for the developer. But it definitely helps my complex and arguably very crufty case. Warning... cringe worthy coding to follow:\r\n\r\nOur app relies on a lot of messy and complex third party data. We delegate a lot, and missing data inevitably results in delegation targets that are nil. For critical user facing elements, we sometimes rescue in the controller or the view. I know this might get a :scream: reaction from a lot of people, but it does allow us to quickly sift out critical pages attempting to display bad data and email those issues directly to our data team. By doing this in the view/controller we can still render some information to the user. It also prevents non-critical background jobs or rake tasks from firing off notifications to our data team.\r\n\r\nI'll be interested to hear what @carlosantoniodasilva @jeremy @fxn think. Happy to answer any more questions from them. If the team doesn't agree with me, I completely understand. I won't let it crush my dreams of one day contributing something back to rails :smiley: I'm sure there will be other opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523cacfabd354364b9002199"}, "issue_id": 10828, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/19500108", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10828#issuecomment-19500108", "updated_at": "2013-06-15T17:26:50Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/southpolesteve/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/southpolesteve/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/southpolesteve/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/southpolesteve/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/southpolesteve", "login": "southpolesteve", "gravatar_id": "aaa6a17e97fc1b96928671476dbaac25", "html_url": "https://github.com/southpolesteve", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/southpolesteve/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/southpolesteve/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/southpolesteve/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/aaa6a17e97fc1b96928671476dbaac25?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F395753709916868ce9a3b58f6125158f.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/southpolesteve/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 471400, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/southpolesteve/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-06-15T17:26:50Z", "id": 19500108, "owner": "rails"}
