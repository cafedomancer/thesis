I agree with @koffeinfrei's definition of the term \"functional\" and to my thinking it is the most appropriate one to use, but it would cause confusion since the term has already been used by rails and I was asked to maintain backwards compatibility in this change. It looks like \"request\" is the most popular term but I think it is too narrow; many of these tests involve multiple HTTP requests. Also, it appears to have been deprecated in RSpec. I am intrigued by the term \"resource\", but again they can exercise several REST-ish resources in a single test and I think that could cause confusion. That leaves \"system\", which describes the right scope for these tests, but I have usually thought of system tests as QA tests and not developer tests.\r\n\r\nIn summary, here are the terms discussed so far in order of my personal preference and considering the trade-offs I shared above:\r\n\r\n* system\r\n* acceptance\r\n* resource\r\n* request\r\n* functional\r\n* integration", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7febd3543c15100b191"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7878#issuecomment-9260712"}
