Otherwise: Consume the remainder of the unparsed-attributes. Let the cookie-av string be the characters consumed in this step.\r\n> 4. If the cookie-av string contains a %x3D (\"=\") character: The (possibly empty) attribute-name string consists of the characters up to, but not including, the first %x3D (\"=\") character, and the (possibly empty) attribute-value string consists of the characters after the first %x3D (\"=\") character. Otherwise: The attribute-name string consists of the entire cookie-av string, and the attribute-value string is empty.\r\n> 5. **Remove any leading or trailing WSP characters from the attribute-name string and the attribute-value string.**\r\n> 6.
