{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11131", "repo": "rails", "body": "> The user agent MUST use an algorithm equivalent to the following algorithm to parse the unparsed-attributes:\r\n>\r\n> 1. If the unparsed-attributes string is empty, skip the rest of these steps.\r\n> 2. Discard the first character of the unparsed-attributes (which will be a %x3B (\";\") character).\r\n> 3. If the remaining unparsed-attributes contains a %x3B (\";\") character: Consume the characters of the unparsed-attributes up to, but not including, the first %x3B (\";\") character. Otherwise: Consume the remainder of the unparsed-attributes. Let the cookie-av string be the characters consumed in this step.\r\n> 4. If the cookie-av string contains a %x3D (\"=\") character: The (possibly empty) attribute-name string consists of the characters up to, but not including, the first %x3D (\"=\") character, and the (possibly empty) attribute-value string consists of the characters after the first %x3D (\"=\") character. Otherwise: The attribute-name string consists of the entire cookie-av string, and the attribute-value string is empty.\r\n> 5. **Remove any leading or trailing WSP characters from the attribute-name string and the attribute-value string.**\r\n> 6. Process the attribute-name and attribute-value according to the requirements in the following subsections.  (Notice that attributes with unrecognized attribute-names are ignored.)\r\n> 7. Return to Step 1 of this algorithm.\r\n\r\ncite: [RFC 6265 section 5.2 (The Set-Cookie Header)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.2)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d87ebd3543c1510084cd"}, "issue_id": 11131, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20251000", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11131#issuecomment-20251000", "updated_at": "2013-07-01T12:46:11Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ykzts/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ykzts/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ykzts/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ykzts/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ykzts", "login": "ykzts", "gravatar_id": "b9025074d487cd0328f1dc816e5ac50a", "html_url": "https://github.com/ykzts", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ykzts/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ykzts/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ykzts/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b9025074d487cd0328f1dc816e5ac50a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb2bb9671f6bda2005155a9078b6fcd07.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ykzts/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 12539, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ykzts/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-06-30T17:32:51Z", "id": 20251000, "owner": "rails"}
