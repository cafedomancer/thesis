Not exactly sure what it is that the license is supposed to protect either, or what putting any kind of restrictions on it means.\r\n\r\nHaving a humans.txt there by default would encourage me to edit it and add my details if it was present in new apps.\r\n\r\nI don't really buy the \"pointless\" argument, because in the worst case, it's just a text file, and a reasonably standard place to put information about the team behind a site.\r\n\r\nThe license issue could be the deal breaker though. Seems weird that an idea like this could have any kind of license, since there's no content or IP to protect. What would \"[the work](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)\" constitute. Can you license what ultimately amounts to having a file of a certain name?", "_id": {"$oid": "523fa3adbd354364b9019b6b"}, "issue_id": 2734, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1954983", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2734#issuecomment-1954983", "updated_at": "2011-08-31T07:53:02Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paulca/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paulca/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paulca/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paulca/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/paulca", "login": "paulca", "gravatar_id": "b408c8d259cc9b98cf69da4afcad92fb", "html_url": "https://github.com/paulca", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paulca/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paulca/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paulca/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b408c8d259cc9b98cf69da4afcad92fb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F310ce61c90f3a46e340ee8257bc70e93.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paulca/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1229, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paulca/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-08-31T07:53:02Z", "id": 1954983, "owner": "rails"}
