In case where people want eyeballs on their changes, they can always make PR in rails. The only thing we tell people not to do is make PR in docrails project (we would love GitHub to allow disabling PRs in projects).\n\nAs far as this PR is concerned, I'll have a look and merge it in.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238077dbd3543c15100cace"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6491#issuecomment-5946344"}
