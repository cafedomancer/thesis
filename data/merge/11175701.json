In that that additional information might be helpful.\r\n - **behavior in production & development environment should consistent:**, unless there is a strong reason to do so. I can imagine someone new to rails generating new app, testing it locally & deploying it. only to encounter that dreaded \"something went wrong\" page & left wondering, why does it work in development & fails in production?  The principle of least astonishment (POLA/PLA) \r\n - Hosting Providers & sysadmin can use this page to quickly troubleshoot errors with production apps. For example, if you are getting \"something went wrong\" page even without having a root path, means something is wrong with server configuration(missing ruby etc) but getting that default index.html page means everything is okay.\r\n\r\nso I think we should display this page in production, if route path is not defined. \r\n\r\n@schneems\r\nYou might want to edit that `index.html` & remove the lines instructing to delete `index.html`  as that doesn't makes sense. \r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523d8932bd354364b9007ab9"}, "issue_id": 8468, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11175701", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8468#issuecomment-11175701", "updated_at": "2012-12-09T20:44:59Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish", "login": "gaurish", "gravatar_id": "cb0b42e452cd13d469565a23a8abe441", "html_url": "https://github.com/gaurish", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/cb0b42e452cd13d469565a23a8abe441?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F58861ae4fb7b472c95e64685229ad9ed.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 235844, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-09T20:44:06Z", "id": 11175701, "owner": "rails"}
