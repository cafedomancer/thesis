In that that additional information might be helpful.\r\n - **behavior in production & development environment should consistent:**, unless there is a strong reason to do so. I can imagine someone new to rails generating new app, testing it locally & deploying it. only to encounter that dreaded \"something went wrong\" page & left wondering, why does it work in development & fails in production?  The principle of least astonishment (POLA/PLA) \r\n - Hosting Providers & sysadmin can use this page to quickly troubleshoot errors with production apps. For example, if you are getting \"something went wrong\" page even without having a root path, means something is wrong with server configuration(missing ruby etc) but getting that default index.html page means everything is okay.\r\n\r\nso I think we should display this page in production, if route path is not defined. \r\n\r\n@schneems\r\nYou might want to edit that `index.html` & remove the lines instructing to delete `index.html`  as that doesn't makes sense. \r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523d8932bd354364b9007ab9"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8468#issuecomment-11175701"}
