And the fact that the upload is a tempfile is not an internal detail as I said, and can bite you if you need (like it's my case) and written, closed file. So probably the best approach is that it's the app's job, if it needs it, to copy the tempfile somewhere.\n\nStill, it feels a bit strange that this refactoring makes something more difficult. But, that's life.\n\nThanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "523dcf5ebd354364b900a52e"}, "issue_id": 7713, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8765392", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7713#issuecomment-8765392", "updated_at": "2012-09-21T13:57:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/porras/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/porras/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/porras/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/porras/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/porras", "login": "porras", "gravatar_id": "45742831d67c80d12cd7b24907b8d760", "html_url": "https://github.com/porras", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/porras/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/porras/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/porras/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/45742831d67c80d12cd7b24907b8d760?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ffcde14913c766cf307c75059e0e89af5.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/porras/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3830, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/porras/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-21T13:57:29Z", "id": 8765392, "owner": "rails"}
