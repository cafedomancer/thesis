{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9680", "repo": "rails", "body": "The problem is that the current implementation of =~ checks two values against the regex. It would appear the fix to get pattern === TZ (for grep to work) would require the addition of a #to_str method on TZ but not sure how we can handle the two values from =~ to maintain parity between the two versions. If we just add to_str that returns @name then we would still be breaking anyone using priority_zones regexes that are matching on the other =~ value. Maybe that's ok?\r\n\u2014\r\nSent from Mailbox for iPhone\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Mar 12, 2013 at 4:56 AM, Carlos Antonio da Silva\r\n<notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> @bdmac please issue a revert commit of the original one, then add yours on top of it with a regression test, it's better if they are different commits.\r\n> I still wonder whether we should fix AS::TZ instead =(\r\n> ---\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9680#issuecomment-14771083", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e782bd3543c1510095a8"}, "issue_id": 9680, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14780787", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9680#issuecomment-14780787", "updated_at": "2013-03-12T15:12:25Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bdmac/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bdmac/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bdmac/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bdmac/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bdmac", "login": "bdmac", "gravatar_id": "bd75fa9879dc67a44461f53ab38e7d62", "html_url": "https://github.com/bdmac", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bdmac/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bdmac/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bdmac/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/bd75fa9879dc67a44461f53ab38e7d62?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff21ff2c15561bd5271169cb7b3e957c1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bdmac/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 47326, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bdmac/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-12T15:12:25Z", "id": 14780787, "owner": "rails"}
