Technically we'd be changing the behavior from what was there, but any case that'd be affected by that would have gotten an error from Arel, anyway.\r\n- I'm not sure how I feel about that one. We'd be introducing duplication of what Arel can handle as a value. I'd prefer something that's a true default.\r\n- `respond_to?` is much nicer than monkey patching `Object`, but we'll need to benchmark it as there's probably a performance hit.\r\n\r\nEdit: misread the second question", "_id": {"$oid": "523cc514bd354364b90025eb"}, "issue_id": 10673, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18152991", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10673#issuecomment-18152991", "updated_at": "2013-05-20T15:33:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif", "login": "sgrif", "gravatar_id": "0f674817f8c6e149518f0a4b4ad3d560", "html_url": "https://github.com/sgrif", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/0f674817f8c6e149518f0a4b4ad3d560?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7f844d9af6961157c094f8d5bbf716a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1529387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-20T15:17:02Z", "id": 18152991, "owner": "rails"}
