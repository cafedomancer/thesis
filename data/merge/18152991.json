Technically we'd be changing the behavior from what was there, but any case that'd be affected by that would have gotten an error from Arel, anyway.\r\n- I'm not sure how I feel about that one. We'd be introducing duplication of what Arel can handle as a value. I'd prefer something that's a true default.\r\n- `respond_to?` is much nicer than monkey patching `Object`, but we'll need to benchmark it as there's probably a performance hit.\r\n\r\nEdit: misread the second question", "_id": {"$oid": "523cc514bd354364b90025eb"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10673#issuecomment-18152991"}
