As an improvement to @codykrieger's original patch, I've converted this to use symbols rather than strings. This should optimize it further, as well as ensuring (with the .to_sym call I make) that you can correctly use the helpers whether you pass `:textarea` as the tests do or you pass `\"textarea\"` as many people do. \r\n\r\nI also noticed that there were 6 tests which didn't yet have the newline expectation for textarea tags, so I fixed them.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, that actually represents a bug in the initial fix as opposed to the current hash-lookup fix. @Fjan: the original fix means that content_tag is broken if you use it directly as opposed to calling the textarea tag helper.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238151dbd3543c15100dca5"}, "issue_id": 5619, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4727751", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5619#issuecomment-4727751", "updated_at": "2012-03-27T21:09:06Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman", "login": "jcoleman", "gravatar_id": "d8d5058aa91cd439f1f486f93f8eb564", "html_url": "https://github.com/jcoleman", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/d8d5058aa91cd439f1f486f93f8eb564?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F518fe206be008d8f98488ba515188a69.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 125331, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-27T21:09:06Z", "id": 4727751, "owner": "rails"}
