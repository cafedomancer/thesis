As an improvement to @codykrieger's original patch, I've converted this to use symbols rather than strings. This should optimize it further, as well as ensuring (with the .to_sym call I make) that you can correctly use the helpers whether you pass `:textarea` as the tests do or you pass `\"textarea\"` as many people do. \r\n\r\nI also noticed that there were 6 tests which didn't yet have the newline expectation for textarea tags, so I fixed them.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, that actually represents a bug in the initial fix as opposed to the current hash-lookup fix. @Fjan: the original fix means that content_tag is broken if you use it directly as opposed to calling the textarea tag helper.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238151dbd3543c15100dca5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5619#issuecomment-4727751"}
