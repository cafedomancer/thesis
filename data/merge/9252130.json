They differ from *integration* tests in that they are black box tests which test the application as a whole, disregarding any knowledge of the internals. *Integration* tests are basically *unit* tests with an external dependency, e.g. model tests.\r\n\r\nSince *functional* is already taken as a legacy term I favor *system* tests.\r\nThat said, I'd still prefer *acceptance* over *integration* though.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7febd3543c15100b18f"}, "issue_id": 7878, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9252130", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7878#issuecomment-9252130", "updated_at": "2012-10-09T08:00:17Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/koffeinfrei/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/koffeinfrei/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/koffeinfrei/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/koffeinfrei/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/koffeinfrei", "login": "koffeinfrei", "gravatar_id": "8342950f34a66d9ec7cfe10b33d5494c", "html_url": "https://github.com/koffeinfrei", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/koffeinfrei/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/koffeinfrei/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/koffeinfrei/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/8342950f34a66d9ec7cfe10b33d5494c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa1dbec36d9bd53d6580586b082efca42.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/koffeinfrei/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 176582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/koffeinfrei/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-09T07:56:16Z", "id": 9252130, "owner": "rails"}
