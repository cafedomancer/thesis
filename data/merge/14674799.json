For example, in my cart_test.rb, I make reference to products(:one).  This works from \"rails test\", but not from \"rails test test/models/cart_test.rb\".\r\n\r\nThe other thing I noticed is that \"rails test <file>\" only supports one filename.  Ideally it would support multiple.  At a minimum it should warn when additional arguments are passed.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5a22bd354364b900608e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9080#issuecomment-14674799"}
