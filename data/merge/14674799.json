{"body": "I noticed two more things.\r\n\r\nWhat appears to be going on is that I used to be able to run individual tests, but now when I try to do so, the helper methods that provide access to fixture data no longer is available.  For example, in my cart_test.rb, I make reference to products(:one).  This works from \"rails test\", but not from \"rails test test/models/cart_test.rb\".\r\n\r\nThe other thing I noticed is that \"rails test <file>\" only supports one filename.
