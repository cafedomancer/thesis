{"body": "This handles cases where there is no manifest, but I think there is an issue with an incomplete manifest that should be handed as well.\r\n\r\nFor example when upgrading an app there is a chance that some assets might not be moved into the assets path, meaning they won't get precompiled and Sprockets will get a hit and return a 404. There may be other edge cases where requests fall through the manifest check. Either way, this is a Bad Thing.\r\n\r\nI think it is preferable to not send ay requests to Sprockets in production, and let the 404 be handled by the webapp in the normal way. Or perhaps just log a warning that 'asset path x' was requested but is not precompiled.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1937897", "created_at": "2011-08-30T00:47:26Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2741#issuecomment-1937897", "updated_at": "2011-08-30T00:47:26Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 2741, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/rhulse", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c440e1b4de59c602067ff603e74b4e7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe517564e98c2825803fdf00b6c0d9ee7.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/received_events", "gravatar_id": "1c440e1b4de59c602067ff603e74b4e7", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "rhulse", "type": "User", "id": 30732, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523fa2e2bd354364b9019af2"}, "id": 1937897, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2741"}
