Also, I agree having a \"blank\" boolean attribute on a model is a terrible idea that maybe should never be considered, however I think overriding nil? is anti-ruby (i.e. most ruby developers will know not to do this, or at least understand the consequences, even if they've never used rails) whereas blank? is a rails construct.\n\nJust checking for nil? will cover the most common case where an uninstantiated object being passed to form_for.  Checking blank? does the same thing but has this tiny little (probably stupid to even point out) consequence where you could have a perfectly suitable object for form_for that gets rejected for no good reason.", "_id": {"$oid": "523df79bbd354364b900be82"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7314#issuecomment-8948960"}
