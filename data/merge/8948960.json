{"body": "A string or symbol will miss the safety check anyways.  Also, I agree having a \"blank\" boolean attribute on a model is a terrible idea that maybe should never be considered, however I think overriding nil? is anti-ruby (i.e. most ruby developers will know not to do this, or at least understand the consequences, even if they've never used rails) whereas blank? is a rails construct.\n\nJust checking for nil? will cover the most common case where an uninstantiated object being passed to form_for.  Checking blank? does the same thing but has this tiny little (probably stupid to even point out) consequence where you could have a perfectly suitable object for form_for that gets rejected for no good reason.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8948960", "created_at": "2012-09-27T18:47:57Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7314#issuecomment-8948960", "updated_at": "2012-09-27T18:47:57Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7314, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thefool808/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thefool808/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thefool808/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thefool808", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thefool808/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/thefool808", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thefool808/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7693ebf5934737ec97d67444fba0975f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F99932f26d3cd5ee34eea395bef353677.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thefool808/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thefool808/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7693ebf5934737ec97d67444fba0975f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thefool808/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "thefool808", "type": "User", "id": 23186, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thefool808/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523df79bbd354364b900be82"}, "id": 8948960, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7314"}
