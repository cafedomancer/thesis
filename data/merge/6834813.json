{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6952", "repo": "rails", "body": "I'm incredibly hesitant to add a dependency on crypto code that's not part of OpenSSL, it's hard enough to _use_ crypto correctly, implementing it's a touch too risky.   If there's an implementation of HKDF in a later version of OpenSSL then we could make use of it there.\n\nSo you mention that PBKDF2 is not ideal due to our keys already having sufficient entropy, if the sole issues is that the derivation will take an unnecessarily long time, then I'm not worried about it.  We'll be generating a handful of keys per application, and doing it once. Are there additional concerns with our using pbkdf2 in this way?\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380195bd3543c15100c176"}, "issue_id": 6952, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6834813", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6952#issuecomment-6834813", "updated_at": "2012-07-08T21:08:06Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-08T21:08:06Z", "id": 6834813, "owner": "rails"}
