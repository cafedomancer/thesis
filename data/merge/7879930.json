Currently `Numeric#second(s)` is documented, but only in its relation to using it in tandem with methods like `ActiveSupport::Duration#from_now`, `#ago`, etc. I can see how it would unclear that the `Numeric` methods return an `ActiveSupport::Duration` object rather than something that acts like a `Time` object until looking at the code.\n\nEither way, I think this might be the kind of commit better suited for [lifo/docrails](https://github.com/lifo/docrails).", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fc08bd3543c15100b8c1"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7398#issuecomment-7879930"}
