{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7398", "repo": "rails", "body": "I think it would be better to more properly document `Numeric#minute(s)`, `#hour(s`), `#day(s)`, etc. This is the sort of confusion that should have been fixable by quickly checking the documentation for #minutes rather than specifying what `#minutes` returns in the documentation for `#ago`. Currently `Numeric#second(s)` is documented, but only in its relation to using it in tandem with methods like `ActiveSupport::Duration#from_now`, `#ago`, etc. I can see how it would unclear that the `Numeric` methods return an `ActiveSupport::Duration` object rather than something that acts like a `Time` object until looking at the code.\n\nEither way, I think this might be the kind of commit better suited for [lifo/docrails](https://github.com/lifo/docrails).", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fc08bd3543c15100b8c1"}, "issue_id": 7398, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7879930", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7398#issuecomment-7879930", "updated_at": "2012-08-20T20:07:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis", "login": "davidcelis", "gravatar_id": "9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidcelis", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3e1a626a9e0c39eb548886c253bf9644.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 36873, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-20T19:08:45Z", "id": 7879930, "owner": "rails"}
