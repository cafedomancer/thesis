But I hope that some of your code, changes the previous behavior of these methods, what we do not want.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is changed, once that you use ```map!``` or ```collect!``` (and any other method with ```!``` at the end), the content of the original instance is changed, then, you may use them with caution. For example, if you use the this ```highlight``` method after your change, it will change the content of the instance passed to ```phrases``` parameter.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nphrases = [\"phrase one\", \"phrase two\"]\r\n\r\nhighlight(\"my text with phrase one\", phrases)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the method call the phrases value can be changed, what never will happen before.
