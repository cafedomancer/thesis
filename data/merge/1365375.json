{"body": "Thanks for the pull request, but there are a few changes still required here:\r\n\r\n1) AS provides a method on the string called encoding_aware? that returns true if the encoding system is available. please use it instead of respond_to.\r\n\r\n2) We cannot hardcode it to utf8. We should probably check default_external or whatever the current code in AD is using for encoding the rest of the request. force_encoding in general is not an option.\r\n\r\n/cc @wycats", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1365375", "created_at": "2011-06-14T11:34:59Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1689#issuecomment-1365375", "updated_at": "2011-06-14T11:34:59Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 1689, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52385148bd3543c15101176e"}, "id": 1365375, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1689"}
