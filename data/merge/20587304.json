Pull request for this fix is https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11357\r\n\r\nThe reason to do the rewind in actionpack-4.0.0/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb, rather than in actionpack-4.0.0/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/params_parser.rb, is to set @env['RAW_POST_DATA'].  If raw_post_body isn't rewound there, then @env['RAW_POST_DATA'] is blank.\r\n\r\nThe baby steps continue, hopefully I now know what to do to not mess up pull requests anymore. Thanks for your patience.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d5ccbd3543c15100823c"}, "issue_id": 11353, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20587304", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11353#issuecomment-20587304", "updated_at": "2013-07-08T09:11:57Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz", "login": "Alamoz", "gravatar_id": "acfe9766803c7317f1143d919755d016", "html_url": "https://github.com/Alamoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/acfe9766803c7317f1143d919755d016?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb9293e1a3e6919cf510a787da16875fd.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 905505, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-08T06:14:13Z", "id": 20587304, "owner": "rails"}
