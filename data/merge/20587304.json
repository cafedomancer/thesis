Pull request for this fix is https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11357\r\n\r\nThe reason to do the rewind in actionpack-4.0.0/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb, rather than in actionpack-4.0.0/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/params_parser.rb, is to set @env['RAW_POST_DATA'].  If raw_post_body isn't rewound there, then @env['RAW_POST_DATA'] is blank.\r\n\r\nThe baby steps continue, hopefully I now know what to do to not mess up pull requests anymore. Thanks for your patience.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d5ccbd3543c15100823c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11353#issuecomment-20587304"}
