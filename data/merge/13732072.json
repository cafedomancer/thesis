Are you suggesting adding the `lib` and/or `vendor` paths to the `config.assets.precompile` setting? (Currently broken per: rails/sprockets-rails#36) Or is there a better way to limit the scope of things added by hand.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I need to vendor a jQuery plugin which also has CSS, a font face, and an image sprite, I'd add the `.js` and `.css` to `vendor/assets/javascripts` and `vendor/assets/stylesheets`. I would also vendor the sprites and fonts in `vendor/assets/images` and `vendor/assets/fonts`, respectively. Adding the entire `vendor/assets` path seems overkill, but manually specifying each asset individually seems tedious (though that might be by design).", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f73dbd3543c15100afe9"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7968#issuecomment-13732072"}
