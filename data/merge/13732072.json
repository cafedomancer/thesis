{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7968", "repo": "rails", "body": "> So if you do `app/assets` in your gem, those are auto included. `lib/assets` and `vendor/assets` are by hand.\r\n\r\nWhen you say, \"by hand,\" how does that work? Are you suggesting adding the `lib` and/or `vendor` paths to the `config.assets.precompile` setting? (Currently broken per: rails/sprockets-rails#36) Or is there a better way to limit the scope of things added by hand.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I need to vendor a jQuery plugin which also has CSS, a font face, and an image sprite, I'd add the `.js` and `.css` to `vendor/assets/javascripts` and `vendor/assets/stylesheets`. I would also vendor the sprites and fonts in `vendor/assets/images` and `vendor/assets/fonts`, respectively. Adding the entire `vendor/assets` path seems overkill, but manually specifying each asset individually seems tedious (though that might be by design).", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f73dbd3543c15100afe9"}, "issue_id": 7968, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13732072", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7968#issuecomment-13732072", "updated_at": "2013-07-24T13:55:40Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman", "login": "stevenharman", "gravatar_id": "3585262a963f04894a749aabccd99a86", "html_url": "https://github.com/stevenharman", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/3585262a963f04894a749aabccd99a86?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb98004311446c60521a8831075423c20.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 48658, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-18T17:09:14Z", "id": 13732072, "owner": "rails"}
