The method seemed to possibly optimize multiple #with_connection blocks by taking a first stab thru the #tables and just filling in true. I did not want to get into assuming and measuring if that was a big deal or not. My guess is my patch of just adding an extra line would be more considerate to performance vs asking #table_exists? for each table that would be in #tables. So if a DB has 200 tables, that would potentially be 200 SQL calls as compared to the single one SQL call  the method optimized for. \r\n\r\nThe more I think about it, the better I like what it does and the one line addition I did.
