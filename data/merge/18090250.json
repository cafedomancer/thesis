I believe route names are global and would not be affected by constraint or scope blocks etc. \r\n\r\nI'm still not convinced that there is no better way forward, and the Rails 4 version bump is a great time to make a change like this. \r\n\r\nDid you consider the two suggestions I made?\r\n\r\n* Have you considered adding a configuration option in Devise so the urls could be configured from the start instead of overwritten?\r\n\r\n* Another option might be for Devise to define it's routes after the host app, and skip routes that have already been defined?\r\n\r\nI don't know if those ideas are feasible, but please do consider them. Also...\r\n\r\n* Please consider testing the difference between Rails 3 and 4 as I explain in the upgrade guide but with routes defined by an engine. \r\n\r\nFinally, please keep in mind that if we revert this change people are likely to be confused (as I was) about how clashing named routes affect each other -- and that just means more github issues for everyone :wink:\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b90046ac"}, "issue_id": 9704, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18090250", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-18090250", "updated_at": "2013-05-17T23:02:24Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk", "login": "trevorturk", "gravatar_id": "c0b6fb3807d7d4f255463ed168c75897", "html_url": "https://github.com/trevorturk", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c0b6fb3807d7d4f255463ed168c75897?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F69cb3ea317a32c4e6143e665fdb20b14.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-17T23:02:05Z", "id": 18090250, "owner": "rails"}
