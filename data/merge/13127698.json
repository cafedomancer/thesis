{"body": "Thanks, but we cannot rely on the vowels `%w(a i u e o)` to handle the article generation, since this is more about sound than it is about the starting char. I'd rather change it to something like \"some application\" or \"some plugin\". I'm going to close this one, but If you want to give it a try and change it, just push force to your branch and ping here that we can reopen.
