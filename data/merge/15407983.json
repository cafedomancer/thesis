I'm fine that we have a transition period, but at some point we should pick that \"rails test\" is the way to run tests in Rails, and deprecate/extract the rake tasks that do the same time.\r\n\r\nWhy `rails test`?  The rake tasks give people a standard place and way to hook pre / post execution code.
