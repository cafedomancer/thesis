{"body": "Alright. I don't feel comfortable shipping the singleton removal in 4.0.  I think our deadline is too close.\r\n\r\nInstead, it is possible to detect that we are inside a rake test task before the application gets loaded.  I've added a diff [here](https://github.com/tenderlove/rails/compare/fastrake) which reverts the rake tasks but makes them as fast as `rails test`.  I had to add a hack to `rails/all` in [this commit](https://github.com/tenderlove/rails/commit/253e6a47634af1ab0ca0a641d87aff5f23c66409), but it allows us to switch the environment to `test` before the app is ever loaded.\r\n\r\nIf we're OK with that hack, I can modify all the test tasks to no longer shell out.  People can have fast tests without using `rails test`.\r\n\r\nHere's output from a test app (using @rubys data):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time rake test:controllers\r\nRun options: --seed 10096\r\n\r\n# Running tests:\r\n\r\n.......\r\n\r\nFinished tests in 0.125721s, 55.6788 tests/s, 103.4036 assertions/s.\r\n\r\n7 tests, 13 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\r\n\r\nreal\t0m2.034s\r\nuser\t0m1.785s\r\nsys\t0m0.234s\r\n$\r\n```", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/15430065", "created_at": "2013-03-25T22:35:11Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9080#issuecomment-15430065", "updated_at": "2013-03-25T22:35:11Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9080, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tenderlove", "type": "User", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5a22bd354364b90060a5"}, "id": 15430065, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9080"}
