And that people do change them.  And specify options like --skip-bundle (see https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/fc3a39b599fbbed86a153b9742258db020eefa3c).\r\n\r\nNetting this all out: Rails doesn't depend on bundler, but apps by default do.  The current docs for assets don't presume that every application will use the defaults.  The proposal is to change this assumption.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this assumption should be reexamined.  But not because \"Rails 4 relies on bundler\".", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e202bd3543c151008fc6"}, "issue_id": 10222, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16406167", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10222#issuecomment-16406167", "updated_at": "2013-04-15T19:27:05Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys", "login": "rubys", "gravatar_id": "e2dda5e47fccc5ff0daa87debf48162b", "html_url": "https://github.com/rubys", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e2dda5e47fccc5ff0daa87debf48162b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fed519c02f134f2cdd836cba387b6a3c8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4815, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-04-15T19:27:05Z", "id": 16406167, "owner": "rails"}
