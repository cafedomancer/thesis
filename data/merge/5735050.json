{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6315", "repo": "rails", "body": "How about a class `Locale` with instance methods `number_to_currency`, `number_to_phone`, etc., and a module with a method `current_locale`, to include it into `ActiveRecord` and `ActiveView`  (or a class method `Locale::current`)?\n\nP.S. Maybe even better: `Locale#money(number)` or `Locale#money_from_number(number)`.\n\nP.P.S. BTW, as functions in Ruby are written right-to-left, i prefer `#currency_from_number` over `#number_to_currency`.\n\n*Update 2012-05-18.*  Here is what i am thinking about:\n\n```ruby\nfrench = Locale.new(:fr)\nten_euros_in_french = french.currency_from_number(10)\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "523e6611bd354364b900fb6e"}, "issue_id": 6315, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5735050", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6315#issuecomment-5735050", "updated_at": "2012-05-18T17:25:50Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov", "login": "alexeymuranov", "gravatar_id": "63c72161fba6e27cb05c078651c5e969", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexeymuranov", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/63c72161fba6e27cb05c078651c5e969?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F063888cd6044f1607e923c4b12d136f8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 712698, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-16T07:31:47Z", "id": 5735050, "owner": "rails"}
