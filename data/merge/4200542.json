{"body": "I like this idea, but can we change a few things?\r\n\r\nFirst, can we just implement `marshal_dump` and `marshal_load` on the `SchemaCache` object?  Second, I'm not sure that loading every model is the best idea for the schema cache.  What about asking for all the tables and populating the cache that way?  For example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nschema_cache.connection.tables.each do |table|\r\n  schema_cache.populate(table)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe not a `populate` method, but something.  I don't really like the idea of requiring every model in order to get the schema cache.\r\n\r\nI have another idea that is related to this: can we enable schema caching by default?  We can use the migration version to determine if the cache should be expired.  Maybe add a `version` method to the schema cache object.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I really like this feature.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4200542", "created_at": "2012-02-27T19:04:43Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5162#issuecomment-4200542", "updated_at": "2012-02-27T19:04:43Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5162, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tenderlove", "type": "User", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c08bd3543c15100e478"}, "id": 4200542, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5162"}
