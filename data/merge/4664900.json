{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5550", "repo": "rails", "body": "@vijaydev I can add the ability to use `-e` in `rails console` no problem. Do you think I should also add the `RAILS_ENV=production` information? As much as I prefer using `-e` specifying RACK_ENV is the only interface consistent over rack and rails commands. If it were me I would default all docs to use the interface that works across all command line commands. I think @jcasimir had some fun ideas on around the CLI between rails/rake on twitter awhile ago.
