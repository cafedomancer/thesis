The tests all pass on my machine. \n\n@pmahoney says there are potentially a whole bunch of confusing patches that were neccesary in master, all very confusing things I don't understand.  I am not sure I am going to be able to handle this, although I hate to see it get in the way of this.  @rafaelfranca, any advice or thoughts?  I'm a bit at a loss here.  Esp since I can't reproduce failing tests locally. \n\n(reopen the ticket while we figure it out?).
