{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6351", "repo": "rails", "body": "You will get memory leak if you update callbacks in runtime in any case with or without a patch \n\n``` ruby\ndef create\n  User.after_save, if: \"some_madness\" { puts 'saved' }  \nend\n```\n\nThis will cause continuous add of conditions into callbacks options hash.\n\nBut, the crazy case:\n\n``` ruby\ndef update\n  u = User.first\n  u.singleton_class.after_save, if: \"some_madness\" { puts 'saved' }  \nend\n```\n\n(I remember someone mentioned this use case once)\nWon't cause memory leak because singleton class will be GCed with `User` object in both cases as well.\n\n\nSo, that memory leak exists right now. This patch is maybe making leak more but not 10 times more.\n\n\n\nAlternatively we can use `chain.hash.abs` instead of `chain.object_id` to identify callback runner method name.\nThis will make less runners to be generated. What do you think?\n\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380a8dbd3543c15100cf1e"}, "issue_id": 6351, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5759470", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6351#issuecomment-5759470", "updated_at": "2012-05-17T07:11:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan", "login": "bogdan", "gravatar_id": "91913f6ab8085bab0f2aa43995ba8ca2", "html_url": "https://github.com/bogdan", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/91913f6ab8085bab0f2aa43995ba8ca2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F926d19e70f74c20f796d376aafa3c6e2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 122436, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-17T07:11:28Z", "id": 5759470, "owner": "rails"}
