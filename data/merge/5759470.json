This patch is maybe making leak more but not 10 times more.\n\n\n\nAlternatively we can use `chain.hash.abs` instead of `chain.object_id` to identify callback runner method name.\nThis will make less runners to be generated. What do you think?\n\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380a8dbd3543c15100cf1e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6351#issuecomment-5759470"}
