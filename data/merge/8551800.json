Querying the full table out from my db with MyModel.all returned 9200 rows.\n\nThe growth in process resident set size after the query was 21m (from 84m to 105m) with the patch applied.  Without the patch, the growth was 29m (from 87m to 116m).  So the patch yielded at 27.5% reduction in process rss growth for this query.\n\nThe average CPU time to do the query was 1.16s patched and 1.22s unpatched, so 5% reduction there.\n\nThis was with Ruby 1.9.3p194, Ubuntu 12.04, and Rails 3.2.8.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f9a0bd3543c15100b4ab"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7631#issuecomment-8551800"}
