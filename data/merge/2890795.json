One named module for all associations, docs, and changelog. There is still a separate module for each habtm destroy_associations method, as we agreed. There's a discussion to be had about whether to emit warnings when redefining an association, but that's probably a different change than this one. For now, I fell back to using `Module.redefine_method` since it is consistent with the old way of defining association methods.", "_id": {"$oid": "523f5c6ebd354364b9017438"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3636#issuecomment-2890795"}
