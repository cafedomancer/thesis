{"body": "I think this change is ready to go. One named module for all associations, docs, and changelog. There is still a separate module for each habtm destroy_associations method, as we agreed. There's a discussion to be had about whether to emit warnings when redefining an association, but that's probably a different change than this one. For now, I fell back to using `Module.redefine_method` since it is consistent with the old way of defining association methods.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2890795", "created_at": "2011-11-27T22:47:17Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3636#issuecomment-2890795", "updated_at": "2011-11-27T22:47:17Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3636, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshsusser", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9f0f89bbd9e1ecfbaab6584e429b7a2f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F1c9ac0159c94d8d0cbedc973445af2da.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9f0f89bbd9e1ecfbaab6584e429b7a2f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "joshsusser", "type": "User", "id": 156, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523f5c6ebd354364b9017438"}, "id": 2890795, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3636"}
