Changing the behaviour of such a method (timestamps), has wider consequences than many other changes. Basically it changes the semantics of all my historical migrations. And changing history is kind of awkward when developing an application incrementally.\n\nTo align a fresh `db/schema.rb` (generated on Rails 3.2.x) with the one that is in production (or with an incrementally evolved development DB) I need to make a migration that introduces (or removes) these not null constraints on all my existing timestamp columns. I think the release notes for 3.2 should emphasize this.\n\nSome people may not care, but one day they will wonder why the production database differs from their test/development, or maybe even differ among team members.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238378fbd3543c15100fe97"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3334#issuecomment-8903824"}
