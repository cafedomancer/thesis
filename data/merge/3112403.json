{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3943", "repo": "rails", "body": "Don't `require 'action_view/helpers/text_helper'` just `include ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper` in your class/module, otherwise you're circumventing the autoload of the `ActionView::Helpers` constant. This constant includes all of the helpers but you still should be able to include individual helpers so you don't have to mix in everything. The reason for all these autoloads is so that they can be eager loaded when running in threadsafe mode since `require` is inherently unsafe when using threads.\r\n\r\nIn this case there is a bug for TextHelper - it uses the tag method so it should include TagHelper and not require it like it does at the moment. Also the SanitizeHelper requires the TagHelper but neither includes it or uses it.", "_id": {"$oid": "52382f67bd3543c15100f547"}, "issue_id": 3943, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3112403", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3943#issuecomment-3112403", "updated_at": "2011-12-12T20:45:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-12T20:45:51Z", "id": 3112403, "owner": "rails"}
