{"body": "I'm :+1: with defining an api for that, and let the 3rd-party adapters use it. It's definitely better than having to override the entire task or something like that, and could cleanup some Rails code.\n\nThe problem is to sync with other 3rd-party libs, since Rails has already some code on that as you said. Anyway, I think we could move this discussion to the core mailing list, since it's a feature change that we're discussing. We can bring people attention to there if necessary.\n\nI'm going to merge this one.
