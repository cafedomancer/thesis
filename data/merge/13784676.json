What if someone has a method like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef fancy_filter(options = {})\r\n  related = []\r\n  query = {}\r\n  if options[:author_name]\r\n    query[:author] = { name: options[:author_name] }\r\n    related << :author\r\n  end\r\n  where(query).references(related)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould it not break things? In cases like this people would have to make sure to omit the `#references` call unless options[:author_name] is present.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ebb9bd3543c151009ba0"}, "issue_id": 9258, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13784676", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9258#issuecomment-13784676", "updated_at": "2013-02-19T17:14:39Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tadast/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tadast/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tadast/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tadast/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tadast", "login": "tadast", "gravatar_id": "bd9b6d9f929adbf8918fe37fb279c43e", "html_url": "https://github.com/tadast", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tadast/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tadast/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tadast/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/bd9b6d9f929adbf8918fe37fb279c43e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9a75816b236e9a4767ae3445130923a3.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tadast/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 218239, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tadast/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-19T17:14:39Z", "id": 13784676, "owner": "rails"}
