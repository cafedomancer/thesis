Though changes to core libs to return `nil` rather than raise exceptions would be fairly drastic and probably unwelcome. @headius wondered about (in JRuby) making errno exceptions not include back traces, which is a bit of a hack and sounds like a lot of work and potential user confusion...\r\n\r\nI'll try to see if I can find or make a demo app to show this in the context of `assets:precompile`.  In one particular app, after a few monkey patches (including this one), I cut the time (in JRuby) from 2m15s to 1m39s, so I was pretty excited at the time.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f66ebd3543c15100ae4a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8046#issuecomment-9852612"}
