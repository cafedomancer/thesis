{"body": "I was wrong thinking there isn't extra overhead in a second `stat()` call (sure, it's in the OS's disk cache, but still must fill in the stat structure twice), so we're in the same situation as the blog post where file-exists case gets a little overhead while file-does-not-exist gets a lot cheaper.\r\n\r\nMaybe I need to rethink this since this pattern (of rescuing ENOENT) is somewhat common.  Though changes to core libs to return `nil` rather than raise exceptions would be fairly drastic and probably unwelcome. @headius wondered about (in JRuby) making errno exceptions not include back traces, which is a bit of a hack and sounds like a lot of work and potential user confusion...\r\n\r\nI'll try to see if I can find or make a demo app to show this in the context of `assets:precompile`.
