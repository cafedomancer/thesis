Though changes to core libs to return `nil` rather than raise exceptions would be fairly drastic and probably unwelcome. @headius wondered about (in JRuby) making errno exceptions not include back traces, which is a bit of a hack and sounds like a lot of work and potential user confusion...\r\n\r\nI'll try to see if I can find or make a demo app to show this in the context of `assets:precompile`.  In one particular app, after a few monkey patches (including this one), I cut the time (in JRuby) from 2m15s to 1m39s, so I was pretty excited at the time.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f66ebd3543c15100ae4a"}, "issue_id": 8046, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9852612", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8046#issuecomment-9852612", "updated_at": "2012-10-28T23:07:52Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmahoney/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmahoney/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmahoney/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmahoney/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmahoney", "login": "pmahoney", "gravatar_id": "27598e1b77ce41fb0bd8a6fc4a3715d4", "html_url": "https://github.com/pmahoney", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmahoney/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmahoney/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmahoney/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/27598e1b77ce41fb0bd8a6fc4a3715d4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F55d630b2da03cc33c4e3f00c113d14d7.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmahoney/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 103822, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pmahoney/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-28T23:07:52Z", "id": 9852612, "owner": "rails"}
