Devise allows you default routes with default names and since we naturally rely on url helpers, we asked users to redefine a route with the same name in case they wanted to redirect elsewhere. But not anymore with Rails 4.rc. I feel like this pull request is hindering legitimate use cases in favor of some limited sense of security.\r\n\r\nIt also feels inconsistent with many other APIs in Ruby (and Rails), where redeclaring something extends or overrides the previous behaviour, but never raises.\r\n\r\nIf we are decided to go along this way, I would at least like to support a `scope` option that allows engines and other plugins to say: \"the routes defined here may collide with something defined previously but that is fine, just give preference to the main one\".", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b90046a6"}, "issue_id": 9704, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18072026", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-18072026", "updated_at": "2013-05-17T16:32:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-17T16:32:28Z", "id": 18072026, "owner": "rails"}
