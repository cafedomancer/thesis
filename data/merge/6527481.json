I envision people putting things on to the queue, not things happening to be put on the queue because of a configuration setting.  I'm not against something similar to this, but I'd rather we have like a `QueueMailer` that people subclass, and *those* are automatically put on the queue.  A global setting leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  We have enough global settings already. :(\n\n/cc @wycats @josevalim ", "_id": {"$oid": "523802c3bd3543c15100c368"}, "issue_id": 6839, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6527481", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6839#issuecomment-6527481", "updated_at": "2012-06-23T19:25:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "login": "tenderlove", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-23T19:25:04Z", "id": 6527481, "owner": "rails"}
