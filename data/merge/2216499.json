I would have no idea what the order of the argument means without looking at the docs. We have two options here:\r\n\r\n1) make it an option as in `pluralize(1, \"blargle\", :include_count => 1)`\r\n2) define a new method called `count_pluralize(1, \"blargle\")`\r\n\r\nBut still insure if it is worth adding as you can easily define it in your apps.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383a17bd3543c151010166"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3151#issuecomment-2216499"}
