It can either turn off autocorrect (if 0), configure the time delay (if >= 1), or automatically run the correction (if < 0). It's clearly more of a personal preference, at least for Git users.\r\n\r\nSome other gotchas with the patch:\r\n\r\n- the join that rebuilds the command line (line 117) will fall over if quoted arguments are used, since they show up in ARGV with the quotes stripped. \r\n\r\n- as noted above, `bundle exec` is not always the correct way to run commands; some people will be running rails as `bin/rails`, etc.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7e0bd3543c15100b14f"}, "issue_id": 7891, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9324463", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7891#issuecomment-9324463", "updated_at": "2012-10-11T00:13:34Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr", "login": "al2o3cr", "gravatar_id": "6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243", "html_url": "https://github.com/al2o3cr", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb20bb95ab626d93fd976af958fbc61ba.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1191, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-11T00:13:34Z", "id": 9324463, "owner": "rails"}
