It can either turn off autocorrect (if 0), configure the time delay (if >= 1), or automatically run the correction (if < 0). It's clearly more of a personal preference, at least for Git users.\r\n\r\nSome other gotchas with the patch:\r\n\r\n- the join that rebuilds the command line (line 117) will fall over if quoted arguments are used, since they show up in ARGV with the quotes stripped. \r\n\r\n- as noted above, `bundle exec` is not always the correct way to run commands; some people will be running rails as `bin/rails`, etc.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7e0bd3543c15100b14f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7891#issuecomment-9324463"}
