Also, it seems that all transactions, once they are rolledback or committed, are never changed so that the list of states in the TransactionState class is unnecessary. I've run a pretty simple test where I do the following:\r\n\r\nTopic.transaction do\r\n  while true\r\n    Topic.new\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nOn my machine (ruby 1.9.3), the amount of memory seems to stabilize pretty quickly and I was able to created millions of objects without any marked increase in memory. Note that the Topic class does not have callbacks.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5b43bd354364b9006114"}, "issue_id": 9068, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12731949", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9068#issuecomment-12731949", "updated_at": "2013-01-26T06:49:19Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn", "login": "wangjohn", "gravatar_id": "ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab", "html_url": "https://github.com/wangjohn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1075780, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-26T06:49:19Z", "id": 12731949, "owner": "rails"}
