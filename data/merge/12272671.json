The solution would be to move the `ordered_railties` method to `public`, but leaving it as `nodoc` since it's not public for user consumption, just for the framework.\r\n\r\nI tried doing that, but then I got a new failure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  1) Failure:\r\ntest_copying_migrations(RailtiesTest::EngineTest) [test/railties/engine_test.rb:102]:\r\nExpected /2_create_users/ to not match \"NOTE: Migration 3_create_sessions.rb from bukkits has been skipped.

Otherwise I'll have to revert, unfortunately.
