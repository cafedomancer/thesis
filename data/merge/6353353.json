{"body": "I use `composed_of` often \u2014 because it's there! \u2014 but I agree it has a complex implementation with too much generality and an API which is hard to understand. In any specific case it's usually easy to roll your own specific implementation (per @iain's comment) which would almost always produce clearer code than the \"magic\" `composed_of` equivalent.\n\nI believe it would send a useful message to simply remove it rather than extracting it.
