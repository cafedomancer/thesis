In any specific case it's usually easy to roll your own specific implementation (per @iain's comment) which would almost always produce clearer code than the \"magic\" `composed_of` equivalent.\n\nI believe it would send a useful message to simply remove it rather than extracting it. Namely: this particular abstraction rarely makes things simpler, and you are better off writing plain old Ruby code (which you can understand and maintain) to achieve what you want.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e2d0bbd354364b900e142"}, "issue_id": 6743, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6353353", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6743#issuecomment-6353353", "updated_at": "2012-06-15T10:10:52Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomstuart/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomstuart/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomstuart/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomstuart/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomstuart", "login": "tomstuart", "gravatar_id": "cd9b247e4507fed75312e9a42070125d", "html_url": "https://github.com/tomstuart", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomstuart/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomstuart/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomstuart/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/cd9b247e4507fed75312e9a42070125d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F766e428d1e232bbdd58664b41346196c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomstuart/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3192, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tomstuart/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-15T10:10:52Z", "id": 6353353, "owner": "rails"}
