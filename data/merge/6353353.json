In any specific case it's usually easy to roll your own specific implementation (per @iain's comment) which would almost always produce clearer code than the \"magic\" `composed_of` equivalent.\n\nI believe it would send a useful message to simply remove it rather than extracting it. Namely: this particular abstraction rarely makes things simpler, and you are better off writing plain old Ruby code (which you can understand and maintain) to achieve what you want.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e2d0bbd354364b900e142"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6743#issuecomment-6353353"}
