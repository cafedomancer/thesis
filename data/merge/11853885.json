(See https://github.com/tchandy/rails/commit/652107e2e137cf18cf517d96ee9063660e86d686)\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with the first element of a array or everything else. It just return `1` or `0`.\r\n\r\nThat said I think the best approach is check if the value responds to `to_i`. The problem with this approach is if we return `nil` if the object doesn't respond to we will change the attribute value to `nil` when it should not change the value at all.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f092bd3543c15100a2e4"}, "issue_id": 8718, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11853885", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8718#issuecomment-11853885", "updated_at": "2013-01-03T18:08:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca", "login": "rafaelfranca", "gravatar_id": "0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03", "html_url": "https://github.com/rafaelfranca", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2c7b84fa30f0cea96a90729afe2970a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 47848, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-03T18:08:15Z", "id": 11853885, "owner": "rails"}
