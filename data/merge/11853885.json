(See https://github.com/tchandy/rails/commit/652107e2e137cf18cf517d96ee9063660e86d686)\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with the first element of a array or everything else. It just return `1` or `0`.\r\n\r\nThat said I think the best approach is check if the value responds to `to_i`. The problem with this approach is if we return `nil` if the object doesn't respond to we will change the attribute value to `nil` when it should not change the value at all.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f092bd3543c15100a2e4"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8718#issuecomment-11853885"}
