I don't know much about the practices of testing in Rails and so I have just gone with the \"whatever works\" development pattern. \r\n\r\nI strongly believe that Rails 3.1 should not be released until this issue is completely solved. If you have a precise reason why you would rather release it with something as critical as generators within an engine still being broken, let me know.
