Should I subtract the value directly in `index_name_length`, etc..? This would make the patch very simple but we lose the ability to fetch at the \"real\" db limits. I don't think we should pollute the code with `index_name_length - RESERVED_CHARS_COUNT` everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe current value is 2 because the current copy logic for indices appends an two prefixes. Previously they were `temp_` and `altered_` I modified them to `t` and `a` so it's 2 chars.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d7baabd354364b900733e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8613#issuecomment-11720882"}
