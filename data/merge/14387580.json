Some thoughts:\r\n\r\n* it may be better to check `:foreign_key`, `:primary_key` and `:class_name` instead of relying on the name of the inverse association.\r\n\r\n* there needs to be some way to explicitly opt-out of the guessing. A fairly common Rails idiom is to make passing `false` explicitly turn off default behavior.\r\n\r\n* definitely want to avoid picking an association with `:conditions` or a lambda attached.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1ea1bd354364b9004dc2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9522#issuecomment-14387580"}
