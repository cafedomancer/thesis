Every time there is a request with AC::TestCase, it calls the method recycle! on request and response object. Here is where it happens:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/thoefer/rails/blob/dccf850d10aa953a4d1c5ba09281da7e5aebda8d/actionpack/lib/action_controller/test_case.rb#L426\r\n\r\nThat said, let's also change that code to call @controller.recycle! and define the recycle! method. The recycle! method can be defined in Testing, which is already included in the controller class:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/thoefer/rails/blob/dccf850d10aa953a4d1c5ba09281da7e5aebda8d/actionpack/lib/action_controller/test_case.rb#L449\r\n\r\nWhat recycle! will do at this point is exactly clean that cached variable @url_options. I believe this is a better solution because it keeps the cache which is important in dev/prod but still works on test.", "_id": {"$oid": "523844f8bd3543c151010d9d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2307#issuecomment-1696529"}
