{"body": "Let's fix this the following way. Every time there is a request with AC::TestCase, it calls the method recycle! on request and response object. Here is where it happens:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/thoefer/rails/blob/dccf850d10aa953a4d1c5ba09281da7e5aebda8d/actionpack/lib/action_controller/test_case.rb#L426\r\n\r\nThat said, let's also change that code to call @controller.recycle! and define the recycle! method. The recycle! method can be defined in Testing, which is already included in the controller class:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/thoefer/rails/blob/dccf850d10aa953a4d1c5ba09281da7e5aebda8d/actionpack/lib/action_controller/test_case.rb#L449\r\n\r\nWhat recycle! will do at this point is exactly clean that cached variable @url_options. I believe this is a better solution because it keeps the cache which is important in dev/prod but still works on test.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1696529", "created_at": "2011-07-31T20:59:07Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2307#issuecomment-1696529", "updated_at": "2011-07-31T20:59:07Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 2307, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523844f8bd3543c151010d9d"}, "id": 1696529, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2307"}
