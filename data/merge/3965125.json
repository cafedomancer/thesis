(I don't know if leak is the right word here...but I think you know what I mean.)\r\n\r\nConsider:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Base\r\n  class_attribute :setting\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Subclass < Base\r\nend\r\n\r\nBase.setting = {}\r\nSubclass.setting             # => {}\r\nSubclass.setting['key'] =  'value'\r\nSubclass.setting['key']     # => \"value\"\r\nBase.setting['key']           # => \"value\" # uh-oh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how headers are set in ARes and it doesn't seem to gel with `class_attribute`. Any other ideas?", "_id": {"$oid": "52381da1bd3543c15100e5f1"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5033#issuecomment-3965125"}
