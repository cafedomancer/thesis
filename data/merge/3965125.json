{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5033", "repo": "rails", "body": "Hey Jeremy,\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing me to `class_attribute`, but it looks like because of the way headers are changed in practice, `class_attribute` actually creates a situation where child headers do leak upstream. (I don't know if leak is the right word here...but I think you know what I mean.)\r\n\r\nConsider:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Base\r\n  class_attribute :setting\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Subclass < Base\r\nend\r\n\r\nBase.setting = {}\r\nSubclass.setting             # => {}\r\nSubclass.setting['key'] =  'value'\r\nSubclass.setting['key']     # => \"value\"\r\nBase.setting['key']           # => \"value\" # uh-oh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how headers are set in ARes and it doesn't seem to gel with `class_attribute`. Any other ideas?", "_id": {"$oid": "52381da1bd3543c15100e5f1"}, "issue_id": 5033, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3965125", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5033#issuecomment-3965125", "updated_at": "2012-02-14T17:07:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markmcspadden/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markmcspadden/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markmcspadden/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markmcspadden/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/markmcspadden", "login": "markmcspadden", "gravatar_id": "185fff6d3aa5c70e337fa84b302050b1", "html_url": "https://github.com/markmcspadden", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markmcspadden/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markmcspadden/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markmcspadden/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/185fff6d3aa5c70e337fa84b302050b1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fdf0aab058ce179e4f7ab135ed4e641a9.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markmcspadden/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1148, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/markmcspadden/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-02-14T17:07:15Z", "id": 3965125, "owner": "rails"}
