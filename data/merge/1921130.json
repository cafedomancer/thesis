If the arity is known, metaprogramming delegate methods with `class_eval` is so simple. I'm not sure why we need an API around it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you change this patch to use `class_eval`, I'll merge it in.", "_id": {"$oid": "523840ecbd3543c151010951"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2711#issuecomment-1921130"}
