{"body": "Ya, current delegate behavior is that it will expose private methods, and we shouldn't break it.  @jonleighton proposed we change delegate to not expose private methods, but I think it's a different discussion.\r\n\r\nI'm also more in favor of just using `class_eval` in this case since it doesn't depend on AS. If the arity is known, metaprogramming delegate methods with `class_eval` is so simple. I'm not sure why we need an API around it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you change this patch to use `class_eval`, I'll merge it in.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1921130", "created_at": "2011-08-27T19:40:49Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2711#issuecomment-1921130", "updated_at": "2011-08-27T19:40:49Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 2711, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tenderlove", "type": "User", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523840ecbd3543c151010951"}, "id": 1921130, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2711"}
