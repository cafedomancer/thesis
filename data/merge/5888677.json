I'll move the methods from being injected on the Numeric class, to a module.  I may open a separate pull request because there have been a lot of changes and rebasing started to get weird on me and I'm not exactly a git ninja.  I will make the changes in a few days.\n\nRegarding monkeypatching ```to_s```, in all the ```to_formatted_s``` examples I've seen, ```to_s``` is monkeypatched:\n\n```\nactivesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/array/conversions.rb\nactivesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/bigdecimal/conversions.rb\nactivesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/date/conversions.rb\nactivesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/date_time/conversions.rb\nactivesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/range/conversions.rb\nactivesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/time/conversions.rb\n```\n\n(as a side note, perhaps conversions.rb is a more appropriate for the file than formatting.rb, given that to_formatted_s lives in conversions.rb for other core_ext code)\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523e6611bd354364b900fb7a"}, "issue_id": 6315, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5888677", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6315#issuecomment-5888677", "updated_at": "2012-05-24T01:22:31Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz", "login": "amutz", "gravatar_id": "aed424af11b9f92cca6c051f75f013b7", "html_url": "https://github.com/amutz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/aed424af11b9f92cca6c051f75f013b7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F77d85e54bebbad4c976bf8fc0923c567.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 919763, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-24T01:22:31Z", "id": 5888677, "owner": "rails"}
