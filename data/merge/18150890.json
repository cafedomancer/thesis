{"body": "I like this overall idea. I'd be interested in seeing an example from an application where this would be useful.\r\n\r\nOne issue with the current implementation: inflecting on the object's class makes it difficult to use patterns like Decorator, because the Decorator's class will be matched instead. Matching on an object's class is also duplicating behavior that Ruby implements itself, as it's generally Ruby's job to decide what method definition to invoke based on a receiver's type. Ruby already does a good job of this: method dispatch is fast, predicable, and supports inheritance and other language features like `method_missing`. It might be worth looking at the instance method version to see if there are any strong downsides.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18150890", "created_at": "2013-05-20T14:40:41Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10673#issuecomment-18150890", "updated_at": "2013-05-20T14:40:41Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 10673, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jferris/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jferris/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jferris/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jferris", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jferris/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jferris", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jferris/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7fd56fa98da45bc532e898132085bd05?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F274231193c4e40abc64d2f2d8cb6b415.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jferris/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jferris/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7fd56fa98da45bc532e898132085bd05", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jferris/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jferris", "type": "User", "id": 7591, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jferris/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523cc514bd354364b90025e8"}, "id": 18150890, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10673"}
