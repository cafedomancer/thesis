I'm not sure if it wouldn't be better to generally convert all vectors into ruby arrays (like described here https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/e209107a518c70c24d3d05ce246b8a79de9c7632/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/oid.rb#L58) or not. OTOH I'd actually love to convert points, uuids, etc. into specialized ruby types that closer mirror Postgres semantics. But that's another PR.\r\n\r\nComments anyone?", "_id": {"$oid": "523df6ecbd354364b900bdda"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7324#issuecomment-12057060"}
