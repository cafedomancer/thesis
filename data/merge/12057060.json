I'm not sure if it wouldn't be better to generally convert all vectors into ruby arrays (like described here https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/e209107a518c70c24d3d05ce246b8a79de9c7632/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/oid.rb#L58) or not. OTOH I'd actually love to convert points, uuids, etc. into specialized ruby types that closer mirror Postgres semantics. But that's another PR.\r\n\r\nComments anyone?", "_id": {"$oid": "523df6ecbd354364b900bdda"}, "issue_id": 7324, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12057060", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7324#issuecomment-12057060", "updated_at": "2013-01-09T17:40:17Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch", "login": "MSch", "gravatar_id": "64afebe5db598b0b043f35560bf940df", "html_url": "https://github.com/MSch", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/64afebe5db598b0b043f35560bf940df?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc73071b4520a9a82990741a84a2144eb.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 7475, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-09T17:40:17Z", "id": 12057060, "owner": "rails"}
