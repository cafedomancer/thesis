{"body": "@rafaelfranca This time round I didn't get stuck with the vector conversion like last time.\r\n\r\nThis actually works, but I'm not happy with some of the code. I'm not sure if it wouldn't be better to generally convert all vectors into ruby arrays (like described here https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/e209107a518c70c24d3d05ce246b8a79de9c7632/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/oid.rb#L58) or not. OTOH I'd actually love to convert points, uuids, etc. into specialized ruby types that closer mirror Postgres semantics. But that's another PR.\r\n\r\nComments anyone?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12057060", "created_at": "2013-01-09T17:40:17Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7324#issuecomment-12057060", "updated_at": "2013-01-09T17:40:17Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7324, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/MSch", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/64afebe5db598b0b043f35560bf940df?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc73071b4520a9a82990741a84a2144eb.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/received_events", "gravatar_id": "64afebe5db598b0b043f35560bf940df", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "MSch", "type": "User", "id": 7475, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523df6ecbd354364b900bdda"}, "id": 12057060, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7324"}
