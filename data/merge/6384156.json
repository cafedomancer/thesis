{"body": "@freelancing-god personally I would inject the `Rails` constant as a dependency of the class under test. i.e.\n\n``` ruby\nclass Foo\n  def initialize(environment = Rails)\n    @environment = environment\n  end\nend\n```\n\nYou can then inject a mock in your test. I see you are stubbing methods on `Rails` in your tests which is also another valid approach (but I prefer injecting as it forces you to be explicit about the dependencies of the object).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6384156", "created_at": "2012-06-17T19:54:11Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6761#issuecomment-6384156", "updated_at": "2012-06-17T19:54:11Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6761, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jonleighton", "type": "User", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380469bd3543c15100c5c2"}, "id": 6384156, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6761"}
