I see you are stubbing methods on `Rails` in your tests which is also another valid approach (but I prefer injecting as it forces you to be explicit about the dependencies of the object).", "_id": {"$oid": "52380469bd3543c15100c5c2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6761#issuecomment-6384156"}
