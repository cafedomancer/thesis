Just because the documentation says so does not mean that it's behaviour people expect.\r\n\r\nIf someone specced an API function named \"does_x\" but the documentation states that it does not actually do x, I don't think people would be okay with that.\r\n\r\nIf it's basic human rights we're talking about, then why isn't it already legal? Why are there protests around it? It's good to know that Rails is not that different to real life politics.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238159dbd3543c15100dd28"}, "issue_id": 5582, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5236330", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5582#issuecomment-5236330", "updated_at": "2012-04-20T01:40:00Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chendo/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chendo/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chendo/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chendo/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chendo", "login": "chendo", "gravatar_id": "6d9386fb23e7f1557cf5409a7d610d34", "html_url": "https://github.com/chendo", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chendo/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chendo/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chendo/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/6d9386fb23e7f1557cf5409a7d610d34?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2417dc8af8570f274e6775d4d60496da.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chendo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2661, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chendo/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-20T01:40:00Z", "id": 5236330, "owner": "rails"}
