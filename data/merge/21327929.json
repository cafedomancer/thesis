{"body": "@senny I did force push and have a single commit (with a different SHA1 digest than the original one) in the [forked repo](https://github.com/swoop-inc/rails/commits/ss_memory_store_cache_size). After that, when I looked at the pull request I had opened, GitHub showed two commits as opposed to the single one. That was the reason I created a new PR. However, now, GH shows a single commit on the [original PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11527). This makes the two PRs identical.
