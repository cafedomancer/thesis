After that, when I looked at the pull request I had opened, GitHub showed two commits as opposed to the single one. That was the reason I created a new PR. However, now, GH shows a single commit on the [original PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11527). This makes the two PRs identical. Since one is closed, I don't see a problem.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d365bd3543c151007f51"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11546#issuecomment-21327929"}
