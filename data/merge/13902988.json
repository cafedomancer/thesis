{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8200", "repo": "rails", "body": "@floehopper yeah those changes were released because they were merged into those branches just to work with latest mocha, but since the merge policy for those branches is \"security fixes only\", they were supposedly ready to be released as is - so they went out *with* the changes. 3-2, on the other way, branched out to release the sec fixes on top of the last stable version (not the branch), and thus not including anything in 3-2-stable branch.\r\n\r\nThis was probably unfortunate but it is how it happened. In any case, we're not merging anything else in 3.0/3.1 branches anymore. And about a new 3-2 release, I agree it's been a while but it had to wait due to the latest sec releases. Lets see if we can get something out soon, thanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f52fbd3543c15100ab8a"}, "issue_id": 8200, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13902988", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8200#issuecomment-13902988", "updated_at": "2013-02-21T17:55:36Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-21T17:55:36Z", "id": 13902988, "owner": "rails"}
