In any case, we're not merging anything else in 3.0/3.1 branches anymore. And about a new 3-2 release, I agree it's been a while but it had to wait due to the latest sec releases. Lets see if we can get something out soon, thanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f52fbd3543c15100ab8a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8200#issuecomment-13902988"}
