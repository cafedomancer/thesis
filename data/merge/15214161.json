So \"rake test\" and \"rake test:units\" will load fixtures. This should do the same. But don't load fixtures when running one specific file or test within that file. In that case, we should have an option like --load-fixtures/-f that does it.\r\n\r\n@dhh why?\r\n\r\nThis change\r\n\r\n* breaks our usage of autotest\r\n* prevents us from running one test file via ruby\r\n* eliminates the possibility of focusing on one failing test\r\n* eliminates the Rake task hooks we use for environment specific setup\r\n\r\nProviding `rails test` seems fine for people that want to use it, but why do we need to remove these hooks?\r\n\r\nBeing able to run one test with just plain old ruby is an extremely important use case for me.  I would like to know the essence of this feature so that I can add support for my usecase again.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5a22bd354364b9006093"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9080#issuecomment-15214161"}
