More neutering of a once great framework. ARes is still bound to Active Record in terms of it just working and all of it's magic that makes it awesome when you need it. I hope this new fork will keep in lock step with it's development too (if Active Record doesn't get cut) and not just die on the vine like the core team let it many years ago.  When you need it, ARes is awesome. \"Most projects\" suck and are small unfinished tripe. ARes does some heavy lifting which i really do hope gets the love it deserves. Fuck, cleaning up the docs would probably be all it needs, and it'll be declared 'genius' and 'refreshing' by the hipster code militia.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385e09bd3543c151012020"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/572#issuecomment-4541206"}
