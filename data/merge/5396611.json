{"body": "/cc @jeremy \r\n\r\nWe already had this discussion on the core room many times. Some prefer the flash to always be swept, even if not accessed. That said, I would like to propose a compromise. Let's merge this feature in, so the middleware is as smart as possible and if one wants to always read the flash, we can have a method in the controller that defines a filter that will enforce the swap:\r\n\r\n    def swap_flash_on_every_request\r\n      before_filter { flash }\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThis will also fix issues people are having with flash expiring on ajax requests or images rendered from the server, so it is a very welcome addition imho.\r\n\r\nFinally, if someone has a flash check on their layout/application, it will be enough to ensure it will be swept. So it likely won't affect most apps.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5396611", "created_at": "2012-04-28T12:56:48Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6034#issuecomment-5396611", "updated_at": "2012-04-28T12:56:48Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6034, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380fd5bd3543c15100d5ad"}, "id": 5396611, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6034"}
