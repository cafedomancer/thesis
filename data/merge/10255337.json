That's an unfortunate problem, but we do need changelog entries. Perhaps one solution is to not ask for changelogs anymore, as @rafaelfranca commented in there, I don't know.\r\n\r\nContribution is important, and I agree with you that these minor things makes it harder and annoying, but until we don't have another solution, we'll have to keep doing it.\r\n\r\nI'll try to bring this discussion again to see if we can come up with a solution.
