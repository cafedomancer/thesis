{"body": "Piotr, thanks for the issue. I agree with you and remove this commit with memory database. The last two commits I found in my practice, the commit with memory db I suggested investigating the sources. It appears that It was not so well fit.\n\nFrankly speaking it's very weird to use :memory: in development (or production :). It's usefull only for test mode (on my box AR tests are passed 2 times faster with sqlite3_mem adapter). May be we should add the notice in guides.
