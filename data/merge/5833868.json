I agree with you and remove this commit with memory database. The last two commits I found in my practice, the commit with memory db I suggested investigating the sources. It appears that It was not so well fit.\n\nFrankly speaking it's very weird to use :memory: in development (or production :). It's usefull only for test mode (on my box AR tests are passed 2 times faster with sqlite3_mem adapter). May be we should add the notice in guides. Or do nothing :)", "_id": {"$oid": "523e8091bd354364b901065f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6150#issuecomment-5833868"}
