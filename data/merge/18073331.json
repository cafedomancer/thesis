I would say that changing from raising to logging makes sense, but it doesn't add up if we decide that overriding routes defined in engines is a legitimate use case.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to revert this change, please make sure that things work as you expect transitioning from Rails 3 to 4, and to make sure the upgrade guide explains the change. My testing showed the orders were reversed from Rails 3 when routes were defined in routes.rb, but I didn't test with engines like Devise.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b90046a7"}, "issue_id": 9704, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18073331", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-18073331", "updated_at": "2013-05-17T18:37:39Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk", "login": "trevorturk", "gravatar_id": "c0b6fb3807d7d4f255463ed168c75897", "html_url": "https://github.com/trevorturk", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c0b6fb3807d7d4f255463ed168c75897?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F69cb3ea317a32c4e6143e665fdb20b14.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-17T16:58:13Z", "id": 18073331, "owner": "rails"}
