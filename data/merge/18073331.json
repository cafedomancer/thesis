I would say that changing from raising to logging makes sense, but it doesn't add up if we decide that overriding routes defined in engines is a legitimate use case.\r\n\r\nIf we decide to revert this change, please make sure that things work as you expect transitioning from Rails 3 to 4, and to make sure the upgrade guide explains the change. My testing showed the orders were reversed from Rails 3 when routes were defined in routes.rb, but I didn't test with engines like Devise.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b90046a7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-18073331"}
