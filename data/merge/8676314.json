I can't understand why this patch causes failures  \r\nin seemingly unrelated functionality... only with postgres adapter.\r\n\r\nApparently it ran into similar problems on master that were solved  \r\nsomehow... but solving them in 3-2 is perhaps beyond us.\r\n\r\nIf we can't get the backport in 3-2, maybe I'll prepare a gem that  \r\ndoes ugly monkey patching in a 3.2 app to add this behavior in, with  \r\nthe disclaimer that the behavior causes weird tests to fail for  \r\nreasons we can't understand -- but you need this patch if you want to  \r\ndo real concurrency in high-contention short-checkout scenarios with  \r\nreasonable behavior.\r\n\r\nI'm having trouble finding the output for 'the locking related one' in  \r\ntravis. If you can you give me a file and line number of the failing  \r\ntest, or the travis output excerpt of the failing test you cant'  \r\nsolve, i'll see if I can figure anything out (working on getting a  \r\nworking postgres locally so I can reproduce test failures again).\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sep 18, 2012, at 9:14 PM, Rafael Mendon\u00e7a Fran\u00e7a wrote:\r\n\r\n> I could fix almost all the tests but the locking related I could  \r\n> not.
