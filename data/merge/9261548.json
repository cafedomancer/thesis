However, I realize I may be biased and have a personal style which lends itself to calling them _acceptance_.\r\n\r\n> [My tendency is to] limit those to true acceptance tests - driven from the outside, from the \r\n> perspective of the consumer, ignorant of as many implementation details as possible.\r\n\r\nThe most compelling reasons I've heard against _acceptance_ is @garybernhardt's objection that acceptance is an objective not a scope. While true in part, it has also long been used as a label for a style of testing (see: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AcceptanceTest).\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no great term that is free of preconception and/or prior definition?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7febd3543c15100b192"}, "issue_id": 7878, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9261548", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7878#issuecomment-9261548", "updated_at": "2012-10-09T14:02:50Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman", "login": "stevenharman", "gravatar_id": "3585262a963f04894a749aabccd99a86", "html_url": "https://github.com/stevenharman", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3585262a963f04894a749aabccd99a86?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb98004311446c60521a8831075423c20.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 48658, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenharman/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-09T14:01:46Z", "id": 9261548, "owner": "rails"}
