I'd like to suggest that this is a poor way to approach MySQL configuration, and should be replaced. There are quite a few possible values of SQL_MODE, and one that I think is really great is called TRADITIONAL (which includes STRICT_ALL_TABLES along with a few others).\r\n\r\nSee: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-sql-mode.html#sqlmode_traditional\r\n\r\nWay too many people have posted private method monkey patches around `configure_connection` that are about setting additional connection variables so, c'mon, if we're going to fix this, let's actually fix it.  Rather than argue about which ones of these to give a specific keyword name to, we should just make it easy to specify the SET variables to send on each new connection from database.yml.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nproduction:\r\n  adapter: mysql2\r\n  database: prod\r\n  user: foo\r\n  password: bar\r\n  host: localhost\r\n  encoding: utf8\r\n  set:\r\n    sql_mode: traditional\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll open a new pull request with some code later on, but, hello and heads up.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e89dabd354364b9010a76"}, "issue_id": 6069, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10748449", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6069#issuecomment-10748449", "updated_at": "2012-11-27T07:25:58Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sodabrew/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sodabrew/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sodabrew/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sodabrew/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sodabrew", "login": "sodabrew", "gravatar_id": "daa42e1741f84c74ec3e6160ea6e5e11", "html_url": "https://github.com/sodabrew", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sodabrew/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sodabrew/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sodabrew/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/daa42e1741f84c74ec3e6160ea6e5e11?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F44ccfe397ecb78a8dc09d6e524c1322d.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sodabrew/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 39406, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sodabrew/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-27T07:25:58Z", "id": 10748449, "owner": "rails"}
