I'd like to suggest that this is a poor way to approach MySQL configuration, and should be replaced. There are quite a few possible values of SQL_MODE, and one that I think is really great is called TRADITIONAL (which includes STRICT_ALL_TABLES along with a few others).\r\n\r\nSee: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-sql-mode.html#sqlmode_traditional\r\n\r\nWay too many people have posted private method monkey patches around `configure_connection` that are about setting additional connection variables so, c'mon, if we're going to fix this, let's actually fix it.  Rather than argue about which ones of these to give a specific keyword name to, we should just make it easy to specify the SET variables to send on each new connection from database.yml.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nproduction:\r\n  adapter: mysql2\r\n  database: prod\r\n  user: foo\r\n  password: bar\r\n  host: localhost\r\n  encoding: utf8\r\n  set:\r\n    sql_mode: traditional\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll open a new pull request with some code later on, but, hello and heads up.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e89dabd354364b9010a76"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6069#issuecomment-10748449"}
