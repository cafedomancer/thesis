The tests exercise the whole stack, from the router/dispatcher to the controller, views, models, etc. The tests can have one session with multiple requests.

I would love a discussion on a better term.\r\n\r\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AcceptanceTest\r\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?IntegrationTest", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7febd3543c15100b184"}, "issue_id": 7878, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9245282", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7878#issuecomment-9245282", "updated_at": "2012-10-09T00:29:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage", "login": "blowmage", "gravatar_id": "cd8da976054ea4915eafc5d9dd096d38", "html_url": "https://github.com/blowmage", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cd8da976054ea4915eafc5d9dd096d38?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd5cfead94f5350c12c322b5b664544c1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 730, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-09T00:29:27Z", "id": 9245282, "owner": "rails"}
