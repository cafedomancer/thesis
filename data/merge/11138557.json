I feel that users will expect both formats\r\n\r\n* most of the methods inside `WhereChain` look similar: do you like them as they are (separate method that repeat some code), or would your rather have them refactored with some metaprogramming?", "_id": {"$oid": "523d97adbd354364b900830d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8332#issuecomment-11138557"}
