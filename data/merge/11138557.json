I feel that users will expect both formats\r\n\r\n* most of the methods inside `WhereChain` look similar: do you like them as they are (separate method that repeat some code), or would your rather have them refactored with some metaprogramming?", "_id": {"$oid": "523d97adbd354364b900830d"}, "issue_id": 8332, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11138557", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8332#issuecomment-11138557", "updated_at": "2012-12-07T17:28:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob", "login": "claudiob", "gravatar_id": "4dea5cf83d2d6c1228750b76e579b38d", "html_url": "https://github.com/claudiob", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/4dea5cf83d2d6c1228750b76e579b38d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F11ed516444b2593eaba7f2c2bb63483e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 10076, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-07T17:28:32Z", "id": 11138557, "owner": "rails"}
