Actually I was about the add a \"guides:generate:all\" task to generate all the guides (ALL=1) but I thought it'd confusing because people might think it'd be to generate html and kindle.\n\n@fxn If changing the scripts in the docs server is a major concern, I can add the old tasks \"generate_guides\" and \"validate_guides\" (which would call the ones I'm proposing), and we could get rid of them later, doesn't make much sense, but I can do it.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nI will change the guide later in the day.\n\nThanks a lot.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238075cbd3543c15100ca7f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6502#issuecomment-5954552"}
