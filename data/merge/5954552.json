{"body": "@vijaydev yes, it doesn't improve anything on terms of functionality, that's why I used the word \"refactor\", because it improves the code (by using namespaces, better than using taskname_namespace, imo, and adds a task per format) but it doesn't change any functionality. \n\nThe only thing I think it's better is that if you need to add a new format, you'd add a task with the name of the format (guides:generate:[format]), set the ENV['format'] in the task and that'd be it, I think it's better to wrap it than setting the environment variable. Actually I was about the add a \"guides:generate:all\" task to generate all the guides (ALL=1) but I thought it'd confusing because people might think it'd be to generate html and kindle.\n\n@fxn If changing the scripts in the docs server is a major concern, I can add the old tasks \"generate_guides\" and \"validate_guides\" (which would call the ones I'm proposing), and we could get rid of them later, doesn't make much sense, but I can do it.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nI will change the guide later in the day.\n\nThanks a lot.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5954552", "created_at": "2012-05-27T16:20:57Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6502#issuecomment-5954552", "updated_at": "2012-05-27T16:20:57Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6502, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafmagana/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafmagana/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafmagana/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafmagana", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafmagana/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/rafmagana", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafmagana/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/40bd727b22d74930f292b63d45a71b07?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F17cf4f4b757e960792210cfcedb91d39.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafmagana/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafmagana/received_events", "gravatar_id": "40bd727b22d74930f292b63d45a71b07", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafmagana/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "rafmagana", "type": "User", "id": 92894, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafmagana/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238075cbd3543c15100ca7f"}, "id": 5954552, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6502"}
