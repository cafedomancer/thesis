{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5153", "repo": "rails", "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nIt might be just me but I see a lot of relation *and* order implied in the names `first` and `last`. And not the unordered kind of order. =D \r\n\r\nMaybe the lack of symmetry between them annoys me because of the influence of Array's first/last.\r\n\r\n@tenderlove I don't know if I see a point in adding a default order and warning at the same time. Looks like not having a default to me... \"I work but don't use me\". =D\r\n\r\nIMO we should pick one way or the other. \r\n\r\n1) Assume a large number of people *do* use non chunked sequential primary keys and expect `first` to respect the primary key order like `last` do and don't warn at all (I'd guess this is most of the people - the minority would have to adjust).\r\n\r\n2) Assume the developer should have no expectation on `first`'s order, always warning if no order was chained and documenting properly on both `first` and `last`.\r\n\r\nI prefer 1 by far.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the destiny of `first` and `last` I agree with @pragdave that we should warn about `offset` being used without a chained order.\r\n\r\nI think `take` (or whatever name we pick - I like take and would go with it) should behave the same as AR's `first` and return a record and not a collection for no params or `1`.\r\n\r\nOnce consensus is reached I'll be happy to update the pull request.\r\n\r\nCheers!", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138dd"}, "issue_id": 5153, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4646752", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4646752", "updated_at": "2012-03-22T19:46:26Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs", "login": "mhfs", "gravatar_id": "9c9854582906c67a71b50833d2d059f1", "html_url": "https://github.com/mhfs", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9c9854582906c67a71b50833d2d059f1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F804506a8b44444c4483864113b922d42.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 78422, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-22T19:46:26Z", "id": 4646752, "owner": "rails"}
