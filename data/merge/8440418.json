Note that the default definition for the current_config writer method was being used in rake db:test:load_structure.  This is why I originally had a separate method for set_current_config.  Based on your feedback I've folded set_current_config into the current_config writer method. \n- when current_config is called from rake db:test:load_structure, the config is set to 'test', rather than based on environment variables (and then reset back to nil to support any ensuing tasks)\n- when current_config is called elsewhere, the config is set based on environment variables\n\nI have validated this fix by re-running the rake db tasks tests in dbs_test.rb.\n\nLet me know if there's any more changes required?  If not, I'll re-run the test suite and let you know when I am done.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523de53bbd354364b900b1e5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7521#issuecomment-8440418"}
