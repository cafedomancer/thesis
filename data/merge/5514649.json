{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2734", "repo": "rails", "body": "Hi all!\r\n\r\nHumanstxt it's a text file with an open writing format because we believe that each person should have the opportunity to display the information as he/she wants.\r\nSo, people may use terms such as \"Site\", \"Thanks\" or \"Team\", or  include drawings, or using the format http://humanstxt.org/Standard.html,... You can see different types of humans.txt in http://humanstxt.org/humans/\r\n\r\nThe idea is to list people who have participated in creating or maintaining a site. The concept is similar to the credits of a movie. If on the one hand, you prefer to make your humans.txt through a database format, you have the template. If on the other hand, you prefer to be creative, you are free to do so.\r\n\r\nWe are human and are imperfect. Therefore we prefer to leave open the file. That's the idea behind the project :)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nH-Team.", "_id": {"$oid": "523fa3adbd354364b9019b77"}, "issue_id": 2734, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5514649", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2734#issuecomment-5514649", "updated_at": "2012-05-04T16:41:54Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanstxt/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanstxt/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanstxt/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanstxt/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanstxt", "login": "humanstxt", "gravatar_id": "da24397b8dcbd5eb9c924535885447a2", "html_url": "https://github.com/humanstxt", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanstxt/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanstxt/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanstxt/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/da24397b8dcbd5eb9c924535885447a2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F5b98cc2cc827237eba0ec441da42ae39.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanstxt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1706458, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/humanstxt/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-04T16:41:54Z", "id": 5514649, "owner": "rails"}
