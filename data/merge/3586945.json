Only `Time` class is aware of DST rules, the one way in which `DateTime` is aware of DTS rules is when calling `DateTime.now`. And that's only because it calls `Time.now.utc_offset` underneath.\r\n\r\nAll other possible ways of constructing a new `DateTime` object will use an offset given explicitly as fraction of a day or zero if none was given. Therefore it does not differentiate between locations with DST rules and we need to have an easy access to local offset as fraction of a day.\r\n\r\nThat's why there is method `DateTime.local_offset`.\r\nIt's used in `DateTime.civil_from_format` which in turn is used when `Time.local_time` is called for time period outside of 1902/1970..2038.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I can do to help you with this pull-request?", "_id": {"$oid": "523824f7bd3543c15100ec98"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4514#issuecomment-3586945"}
