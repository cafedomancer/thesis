{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6344", "repo": "rails", "body": "Well, this is related to #6825 and pull request #6835.  @mauricio do you have any ideas how we could handle this?  We use SQLite3 in dev and Oracle in production (setting up Oracle is **too** hard).  That said, we don't have any time only columns at work.\n\n@erichmenge I'm not sure if I have a better approach.  TBH, it seems like if we can't truly support `time` in sqlite3, we probably shouldn't allow people to use it in migrations.  I think what I'm trying to say is \"the type you use in your migration should be the same as the type generated in scheme.rb\".  If we can't deal with times in sqlite3, maybe we raise an exception?\n\nOTOH, we could just say \"this is a place where we **can't** make databases behave the same\" and skip tests in sqlite3 on #6835.\n\n@erichmenge thoughts?", "_id": {"$oid": "52380aabbd3543c15100cf40"}, "issue_id": 6344, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6529620", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6344#issuecomment-6529620", "updated_at": "2012-06-24T01:05:31Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "login": "tenderlove", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-24T01:05:31Z", "id": 6529620, "owner": "rails"}
