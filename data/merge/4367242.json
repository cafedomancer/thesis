{"body": "Hey Bros.\r\n\r\nUmm... I had the same mesasge as  @rafaelfranca, but it seems that others had the another message.\r\n\r\nI hope: I don't want to execute \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `foo-bar`.* to 'rails'@'localhost';\" because I think making this setting only for this test is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n```\r\nI'm a little bit worried this may make the test more brittle. Lets say tomorrow mysql changes the error message, we'll never know because the test will continue passing - I know it's unlikely to happen, but who knows.\r\n```\r\nAgree with an above mention.\r\n\r\nI want use exactly and short sentence.\r\nThus, +1 @rafaelfranca's plan :)\r\n\r\n```\r\nassert_match(/database 'foo-bar'/, e.inspect)\r\n```", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4367242", "created_at": "2012-03-07T12:31:42Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5306#issuecomment-4367242", "updated_at": "2012-03-07T12:31:42Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5306, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/kennyj", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/1f0b221851379759360d7130dabdfa53?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F54ecc28e9508fcf28363014b0d1b4eb8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/received_events", "gravatar_id": "1f0b221851379759360d7130dabdfa53", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "kennyj", "type": "User", "id": 13426, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523819fbbd3543c15100e2ae"}, "id": 4367242, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5306"}
