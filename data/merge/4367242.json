I had the same mesasge as  @rafaelfranca, but it seems that others had the another message.\r\n\r\nI hope: I don't want to execute \"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `foo-bar`.* to 'rails'@'localhost';\" because I think making this setting only for this test is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n```\r\nI'm a little bit worried this may make the test more brittle. Lets say tomorrow mysql changes the error message, we'll never know because the test will continue passing - I know it's unlikely to happen, but who knows.\r\n```\r\nAgree with an above mention.\r\n\r\nI want use exactly and short sentence.\r\nThus, +1 @rafaelfranca's plan :)\r\n\r\n```\r\nassert_match(/database 'foo-bar'/, e.inspect)\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "523819fbbd3543c15100e2ae"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5306#issuecomment-4367242"}
