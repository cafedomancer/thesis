But even other than performance, `define_method` usually (this case included) involves cleaner and more readable code (e.g. less need for the now-removed comments(*) which were needed previously to easily understand what the method is doing), plus easier to maintain (editors have better time with indenting, syntax highlighting, etc). Plus things like JRuby sometimes are more stable on well-defined dynamic constructs such as `define_method`, as opposed to carte blanche `eval`s.\r\n\r\nIMHO, that the cumulative benefits expands beyond a \"cosmetic\" change into a bona fide Refactor, and should be welcome in the absense of reasons to *not* accept it (e.g. evidence of a noticeable performance *loss*)\r\n\r\n(*) I'd still keep the comments though, but this is beside the point.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dd47bd3543c151008ab5"}, "issue_id": 10600, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17853874", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10600#issuecomment-17853874", "updated_at": "2013-05-14T02:54:09Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg", "login": "egilburg", "gravatar_id": "cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6", "html_url": "https://github.com/egilburg", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F552d65b6e9616642fd0217dc7f8361bd.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 242532, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-14T02:47:56Z", "id": 17853874, "owner": "rails"}
