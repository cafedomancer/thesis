That object could define the public methods that we wish to support.  In fact [this blog entry](http://ceaude.twoticketsplease.de/articles/ruby-and-the-principle-of-unwelcome-surprise.html) goes in to pretty good detail about why instance evaling things is annoying for object composition, and I tend to agree.\r\n\r\nI'm not excited about this.  Maybe someone else would like to merge? @josevalim @jonleighton?", "_id": {"$oid": "52383482bd3543c15100fb63"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3603#issuecomment-2701757"}
