{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3603", "repo": "rails", "body": "I'm starting to regret merging the previous \"sexy migrations\" commit. `instance_eval` has the following bad characteristics:\r\n\r\n* allows private methods to be exposed as public API\r\n* bad for object composition (people must declare a lambda then instance_eval it to reuse that lambda)\r\n* Annoying to support (see the arity check on the block in this patch)\r\n* limits us to using blocks (again, see the arity check in this patch)\r\n\r\nWe could probably mitigate these issues by creating another object against which we perform the `instance_eval`.  That object could define the public methods that we wish to support.  In fact [this blog entry](http://ceaude.twoticketsplease.de/articles/ruby-and-the-principle-of-unwelcome-surprise.html) goes in to pretty good detail about why instance evaling things is annoying for object composition, and I tend to agree.\r\n\r\nI'm not excited about this.  Maybe someone else would like to merge? @josevalim @jonleighton?", "_id": {"$oid": "52383482bd3543c15100fb63"}, "issue_id": 3603, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2701757", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3603#issuecomment-2701757", "updated_at": "2011-11-10T21:55:14Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "login": "tenderlove", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-10T21:55:14Z", "id": 2701757, "owner": "rails"}
