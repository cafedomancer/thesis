{"body": "> The current solution is fine, except that I would register it to :erb and not the handler class. We could also possibly allow more than one tracker per extension.\r\n\r\nI don't see an easy way of getting to `:erb`, though, as only the handler is stored on the Template as far as I can see. The knowledge is contained within the Resolver. I could move call into Resolver perhaps, and add a `#dependencies` attribute to Template:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# resolver.rb\r\ndependencies = DependencyTracker.find_dependencies(extension, template)\r\ntemplate.dependencies = dependencies\r\n\r\n# The Digestor would just read Template#dependencies.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> The name is fine except I would call it ERBTracker for consistency with the template handler.\r\n\r\nSure.
