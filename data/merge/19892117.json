For my projects I define a generic and representative set of factories to be compiled into fixtures using fixture_builder, and still use raw factories for the one-off cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, the link to Shoulda seems to not be working (takes you to generic thoughtbot/community). Shoulda-matchers still work. I'm not sure whether shoulda itself (as opposed to shoulda-matchers) is discontinued.", "_id": {"$oid": "523c9d76bd354364b9001b05"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11059#issuecomment-19892117"}
