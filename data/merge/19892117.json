{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11059", "repo": "rails", "body": "I propose adding the following link to the links:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* [Fixture Builder](https://github.com/rdy/fixture_builder), a tool that compiles Ruby factories into fixtures before a test run.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPersonal note: I found this tool very useful as it allows best of both worlds - flexible easier to maintain factories (because of dynamic associations, sequences, callbacks, ruby validations, etc) with the performance of static fixtures (very fast transactional db rollbacks that go with them, as opposed to wiping and re-inserting in db large volumes of fixture data after every single test which is SLOW). For my projects I define a generic and representative set of factories to be compiled into fixtures using fixture_builder, and still use raw factories for the one-off cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, the link to Shoulda seems to not be working (takes you to generic thoughtbot/community). Shoulda-matchers still work. I'm not sure whether shoulda itself (as opposed to shoulda-matchers) is discontinued.", "_id": {"$oid": "523c9d76bd354364b9001b05"}, "issue_id": 11059, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/19892117", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11059#issuecomment-19892117", "updated_at": "2013-06-24T07:14:47Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg", "login": "egilburg", "gravatar_id": "cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6", "html_url": "https://github.com/egilburg", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F552d65b6e9616642fd0217dc7f8361bd.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 242532, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-06-24T07:12:14Z", "id": 19892117, "owner": "rails"}
