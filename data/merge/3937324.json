The page loads without image and it's easy to miss it. On the other hand in prod environment (with precompiled assets) you get an exception that crashes the whole page while rendering it.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381dcebd3543c15100e629"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5020#issuecomment-3937324"}
