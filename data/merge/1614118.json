If we want to emulate 1.9 then we should test for the rest of the whitespace characters. But then in 1.8 the regexp engines knows nothing about the encoding and looks like a blind guess to me to hard-code that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that may be subject of a later revision, I think this particular PR is good to go.", "_id": {"$oid": "523fdad1bd354364b901b9f3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2146#issuecomment-1614118"}
