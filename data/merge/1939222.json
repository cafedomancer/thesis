Will test more in the morning. Others should test too, please :-)", "_id": {"$oid": "523fa2e2bd354364b9019af6"}, "issue_id": 2741, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1939222", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2741#issuecomment-1939222", "updated_at": "2011-08-30T05:14:16Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse", "login": "rhulse", "gravatar_id": "1c440e1b4de59c602067ff603e74b4e7", "html_url": "https://github.com/rhulse", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c440e1b4de59c602067ff603e74b4e7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe517564e98c2825803fdf00b6c0d9ee7.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 30732, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-08-30T05:14:16Z", "id": 1939222, "owner": "rails"}
