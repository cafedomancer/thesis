{"body": ">> How do we deprecate this behavior and remain backwards compatible?\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure this has ever been a Rails priority :),\r\n\r\nObviously I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't (break backwards compat). :-P\r\n\r\nWould you like to volunteer for fielding complaints when someone reports a ticket about this changing?  If so, let's do it.  But we *must* add a `take` method to give people who rely on the behavior an upgrade path.\r\n\r\n> I agree, but the last() method already assumes that ordering is based on id().\r\n\r\nYes, and I'm saying that if the table is an **unordered** collection, you shouldn't rely on `last` ordering by id.  Maybe I should file a bug that `last` doesn't work correctly on my sharded tables?\r\n\r\n> However, I do think it would be very worthwhile to add a warning to an ARel chain that uses offset() but not order(), because the use of offset() really does imply that you want deterministic order.\r\n\r\nAgreed.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4644144", "created_at": "2012-03-22T17:42:41Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4644144", "updated_at": "2012-03-22T17:42:41Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5153, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tenderlove", "type": "User", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138d5"}, "id": 4644144, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5153"}
