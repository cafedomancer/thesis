If so, let's do it.  But we *must* add a `take` method to give people who rely on the behavior an upgrade path.\r\n\r\n> I agree, but the last() method already assumes that ordering is based on id().\r\n\r\nYes, and I'm saying that if the table is an **unordered** collection, you shouldn't rely on `last` ordering by id.  Maybe I should file a bug that `last` doesn't work correctly on my sharded tables?\r\n\r\n> However, I do think it would be very worthwhile to add a warning to an ARel chain that uses offset() but not order(), because the use of offset() really does imply that you want deterministic order.\r\n\r\nAgreed.", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138d5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4644144"}
