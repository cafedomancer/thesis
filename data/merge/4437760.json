{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5372", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks! One question: if I invoke `MyMailer.name_of_email`, it will still invoke the callback right? If so, `before_send` maybe not be the most appropriate name. Also, the fact the callback is being triggered *after* we do the whole setup may be dangerous, for example, maybe headers won't be copied over anymore or parsed properly.\r\n\r\nThat said, what if we follow the same API as the controller and provide both `before_filter` and `after_filter`? I guess those make clear it happens before and after the action, maybe we could even re-use AbstractController::Callbacks implementation. What do you think?\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52381923bd3543c15100e14f"}, "issue_id": 5372, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4437760", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5372#issuecomment-4437760", "updated_at": "2012-03-11T09:25:31Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-11T09:25:31Z", "id": 4437760, "owner": "rails"}
