{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9080", "repo": "rails", "body": "@drbrain the original problem was that running test via `rake` had to load the Rails environment twice. (One for `rake`'s environment, then `rake` would call `ruby -Itest ...` which is the second.) We kinda want to eliminate that by just load the test files into the runner; hence the usage of `load` command. On a rainy day, that could mean the test took twice the load time than running the test directly via some command.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5a22bd354364b900607c"}, "issue_id": 9080, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12743879", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9080#issuecomment-12743879", "updated_at": "2013-01-26T22:44:34Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu", "login": "sikachu", "gravatar_id": "f1c4a3bb1606cc4a61711e61e2fe6146", "html_url": "https://github.com/sikachu", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f1c4a3bb1606cc4a61711e61e2fe6146?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a4526b1ec301744aba9526d78fcb2a6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4912, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-26T22:44:34Z", "id": 12743879, "owner": "rails"}
