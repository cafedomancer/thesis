(One for `rake`'s environment, then `rake` would call `ruby -Itest ...` which is the second.) We kinda want to eliminate that by just load the test files into the runner; hence the usage of `load` command. On a rainy day, that could mean the test took twice the load time than running the test directly via some command.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5a22bd354364b900607c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9080#issuecomment-12743879"}
