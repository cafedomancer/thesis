It is clearly missing:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/show_exceptions.rb#L119\r\n\r\nWe can get the default from AD::Response:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/response.rb#L57\r\n\r\nCould you please update the pull request? And please add a test for the charset case?\r\n\r\nPS: @spastorino, this will probably work on Exceptron because we use the controller which automatically uses AD::Response and sets the charset. But we need to update the template as in this pull request and add a test for the charset.", "_id": {"$oid": "52386132bd3543c151012311"}, "issue_id": 375, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1093504", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/375#issuecomment-1093504", "updated_at": "2011-05-03T12:15:46Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-03T12:15:46Z", "id": 1093504, "owner": "rails"}
