Especially, the HTTP Content-Type header and any BOM elements have precedence over this element.\"\r\n\r\nI would prefer if we set the charset on the content-type header instead. It is clearly missing:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/show_exceptions.rb#L119\r\n\r\nWe can get the default from AD::Response:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/response.rb#L57\r\n\r\nCould you please update the pull request? And please add a test for the charset case?\r\n\r\nPS: @spastorino, this will probably work on Exceptron because we use the controller which automatically uses AD::Response and sets the charset. But we need to update the template as in this pull request and add a test for the charset.", "_id": {"$oid": "52386132bd3543c151012311"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/375#issuecomment-1093504"}
