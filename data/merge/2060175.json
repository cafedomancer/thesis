I added the entry in the 3.2.0 section since I did these changes off of master, but it seems like a reasonable idea for this to go into 3-1-stable too. Not sure how you guys decide that.\r\n\r\nAlso, I pushed these commits to a different csrf_token_warning branch under md5/rails. I'm not going to be pushing any other commits to my master any time soon, but I can redo the pull request from that branch if you like.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383d05bd3543c151010440"}, "issue_id": 2972, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2060175", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2972#issuecomment-2060175", "updated_at": "2011-09-10T16:59:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/md5/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/md5/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/md5/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/md5/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/md5", "login": "md5", "gravatar_id": "2d698e867b4281d2c6fcc9bc96780852", "html_url": "https://github.com/md5", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/md5/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/md5/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/md5/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2d698e867b4281d2c6fcc9bc96780852?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F103945184536a04de81a534a38d4a504.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/md5/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 76367, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/md5/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-09-10T16:59:37Z", "id": 2060175, "owner": "rails"}
