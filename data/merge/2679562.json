And it is common for `ERB::Util` have aliases based on the escape method: http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.2/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB/Util.html\r\n\r\nIt also freaks me out that some methods are called json_escape and others escape_javascript (I always get confused). It also annoys me they are in different files. Maybe the best solution would be:\r\n\r\n1) Move escape_javascript to `ERB::Util` as well (or move all to AV::Helpers::EscapeHelper)\r\n2) Alias escape_javascript to js\r\n3) Deprecate `j` in all cases\r\n\r\nBut I am not sure.
