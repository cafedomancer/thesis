Or if it is still working in MySQL and PostgreSQL and SQLite3 then maybe make this test just for these databases.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384cabbd3543c15101144e"}, "issue_id": 1882, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1459518", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1882#issuecomment-1459518", "updated_at": "2011-06-28T22:19:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsim", "login": "rsim", "gravatar_id": "634c7a5c6e7c5e50b431632c7d3b2d92", "html_url": "https://github.com/rsim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/634c7a5c6e7c5e50b431632c7d3b2d92?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8df6a65941e4c9da40a4fb899de65c55.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4736, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rsim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-28T22:19:51Z", "id": 1459518, "owner": "rails"}
