{"body": "A little more background on why I suggested this change -- I ran into a subtle issue when upgrading Basecamp to Rails 4. It took a while to track down and I eventually found it was because the order of named route lookups had been reversed between Rails 3 and 4. I couldn't think of a good reason to have two routes with the same name and suggested we fail loudly and quickly to help people avoid subtle issues like the one I ran into.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I didn't think of this particular issue, and I'm sure there are more I haven't thought of as well. \r\n\r\nI'm a bit out of touch with Devise right now, but I wonder if it really makes sense to have two `root` routes? Can you elaborate on the reasoning behind that? Perhaps it'll inform our decision here -- we may want change this behavior to log instead of raising an error. We may also consider just leaving a note in the upgrade guide. That's what I did initially in d717882eb501510b8367382ea7d6c0097aac38cf but later decided that raising an exception might be a smarter thing to do. \r\n\r\nThis is definitely worth more discussion -- sorry for the long winded comment, in any case, though :wink: ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17298803", "created_at": "2013-05-01T18:49:37Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-17298803", "updated_at": "2013-05-01T18:50:05Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9704, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/trevorturk", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c0b6fb3807d7d4f255463ed168c75897?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F69cb3ea317a32c4e6143e665fdb20b14.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/received_events", "gravatar_id": "c0b6fb3807d7d4f255463ed168c75897", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "trevorturk", "type": "User", "id": 402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b900469a"}, "id": 17298803, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9704"}
