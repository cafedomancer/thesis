What if somebody does:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Post\r\n  connection.create_table :posts do |t|\r\n    t.string :title\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def title\r\n    \"foo\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill `Post.select(:id).first.respond_to?(:title)` return true or false? It should be true in this case, but I'm not sure it will be, looking at your code. And it might not be possible to get this correct without resorting to crazy hacks, I'm not sure.", "_id": {"$oid": "523cf003bd354364b90034fe"}, "issue_id": 10211, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16412799", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10211#issuecomment-16412799", "updated_at": "2013-04-15T21:32:36Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "login": "jonleighton", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-04-15T21:32:36Z", "id": 16412799, "owner": "rails"}
