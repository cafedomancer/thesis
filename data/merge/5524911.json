I just checked https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/cache/file_store.rb#L79 on master and it still doesn't have any exception logging.\r\n\r\nHowever, looking at https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/cache/mem_cache_store.rb#L128, you will see that along with rescuing the exception, the exception is logged and this allows anyone to review the error easily.\r\n\r\nSo the exception in file store should be logged too, as part of the convention, and to aid in debugging the error.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c8bbd3543c15100e4e8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5125#issuecomment-5524911"}
