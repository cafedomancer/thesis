Both fluctuated, but always came within a hundredth of a second of each other for 10 thousand runs of the loop. The difference in load time under normal use, one run of the loop, would be non-existent.\r\n\r\nI think that the loop will help the code readability more than it hurts performance, but if there's still opposition to that I'll change it back.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: Haha. Just for shits and giggles (and out of a bit of curiosity) I did this [same thing in C](https://gist.github.com/aa6f7ebb676591ad7192), it consistently times at 0m0.003s real.", "_id": {"$oid": "523da629bd354364b9008b92"}, "issue_id": 8147, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10203708", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8147#issuecomment-10203708", "updated_at": "2012-11-08T21:15:17Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbchaosmaster/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbchaosmaster/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbchaosmaster/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbchaosmaster/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbchaosmaster", "login": "gbchaosmaster", "gravatar_id": "6bea4182cd4dca98f1bc2f525283c27a", "html_url": "https://github.com/gbchaosmaster", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbchaosmaster/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbchaosmaster/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbchaosmaster/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/6bea4182cd4dca98f1bc2f525283c27a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff6ba561745f4270fad76db4799b9db8d.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbchaosmaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1045694, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gbchaosmaster/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-08T20:33:47Z", "id": 10203708, "owner": "rails"}
