It seems as though the ``PerThreadRegistry`` module is already loaded whenever the tests are called.\r\n\r\nI think this is because ``ActiveSupport::Notifications`` is already requiring the module, and one of the methods inside of ``ActiveSupport::Subscriber`` calls the notifications module. Do you think I should still include a require on the ``PerThreadRegistry`` just in case somehow the module doesn't get loaded?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e0f0bd3543c151008f30"}, "issue_id": 10285, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16736918", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10285#issuecomment-16736918", "updated_at": "2013-04-21T17:33:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn", "login": "wangjohn", "gravatar_id": "ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab", "html_url": "https://github.com/wangjohn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1075780, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-04-21T17:33:29Z", "id": 16736918, "owner": "rails"}
