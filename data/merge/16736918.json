It seems as though the ``PerThreadRegistry`` module is already loaded whenever the tests are called.\r\n\r\nI think this is because ``ActiveSupport::Notifications`` is already requiring the module, and one of the methods inside of ``ActiveSupport::Subscriber`` calls the notifications module. Do you think I should still include a require on the ``PerThreadRegistry`` just in case somehow the module doesn't get loaded?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e0f0bd3543c151008f30"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10285#issuecomment-16736918"}
