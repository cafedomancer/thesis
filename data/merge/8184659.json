I see a lot of newbies who are confused with how JavaScript and Rails work together and this should help them.\r\n\r\nOne thing I have not seen covered in this discussion so far is the organization of JavaScript files within the app. Perhaps that could also be mentioned?\r\n\r\nOn 31/08/2012, at 4:25, Steve Klabnik <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> I did a poll on Twitter to see what parts of Rails needed documentation the most, and one glaring thing that was pointed out was how out of date the AJAX guide was.\r\n> \r\n> Currently, this request is not ready to be merged, but I wanted to get some feedback on what I plan to do before I bother to write the entire thing.\r\n> \r\n> Basically, I built a new outline, and threw a quick paragraph or two together for a bunch of the parts.\r\n> \r\n> Current guide (NOT the one I'm working on) is here, for reference.\r\n> \r\n> Questions\r\n> \r\n> Some specific feedback I'd like addressed before I flesh this out more:\r\n> \r\n> Intro to AJAX\r\n> \r\n> When this guide was written, AJAX was a bit newer of a technique.

Obviously, \"How to write a heavy JS app\" is out of the scope of this guide, but I felt that mentioning tools that people can transition to once they get a lot of JS going would make sense.
