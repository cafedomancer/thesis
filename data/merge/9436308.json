{"body": "@rafaelfranca perhaps I miss notification about your previous comment. I think we should make decision together how to implement this with the best interface. So as I see we have some solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Make this functionality default\r\n2. Create special option\r\n    * add_classes\r\n    * css_classes\r\n    *  with_css_classes\r\n\r\nI vote for creating option <code>with_css_classes</code>\r\n\r\nPlease share your opinion and reopen the pull request. Than I reimplement it and prepare valid pull request.\r\n\r\nI hope it will be helpful for developers that use rails.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9436308", "created_at": "2012-10-15T07:22:36Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5553#issuecomment-9436308", "updated_at": "2012-10-15T07:26:38Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5553, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/butcher/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/butcher/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/butcher/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/butcher", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/butcher/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/butcher", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/butcher/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/a3ab353191f97f7a782e5d64fc3bda3c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Faf885e92d18e71365cfcbb9642c4ec60.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/butcher/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/butcher/received_events", "gravatar_id": "a3ab353191f97f7a782e5d64fc3bda3c", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/butcher/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "butcher", "type": "User", "id": 94034, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/butcher/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52381608bd3543c15100ddcf"}, "id": 9436308, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5553"}
