I think we should make decision together how to implement this with the best interface. So as I see we have some solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Make this functionality default\r\n2. Create special option\r\n    * add_classes\r\n    * css_classes\r\n    *  with_css_classes\r\n\r\nI vote for creating option <code>with_css_classes</code>\r\n\r\nPlease share your opinion and reopen the pull request. Than I reimplement it and prepare valid pull request.\r\n\r\nI hope it will be helpful for developers that use rails.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381608bd3543c15100ddcf"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5553#issuecomment-9436308"}
