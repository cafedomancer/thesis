{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7202", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks for this btw, I just ran into an issue where I wish I could have used this in rails 3.2 :) What do you think of adding an interface for this as an instance method so you could do something like this in addition to inside of the hash:\n\n```\ndef somemail(user)\n  self.perform_deliveries = false unless user.sendable?\n  mail :to => user.email, :subject => ... \nend\n```\n\nWhen I am writing ruby methods, I typically have early returns under the method definition since I almost immediately know if my arguments are good or bad. Having that \"hidden\" in the hash at the end is less obvious, especially if it is added to the end and the line is long. Ideally I would like to be able to just say `return false`, but i'm not sure that would work since we would then call `deliver` on false. What do you think about a possible interface like that, would it be welcomed, or would it be a tough sell?
