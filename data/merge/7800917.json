Having that \"hidden\" in the hash at the end is less obvious, especially if it is added to the end and the line is long. Ideally I would like to be able to just say `return false`, but i'm not sure that would work since we would then call `deliver` on false. What do you think about a possible interface like that, would it be welcomed, or would it be a tough sell?
