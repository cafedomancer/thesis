It feels wrong to me that I need to keep the responsibility of checking my arguments to my mailers outside of the methods. \n\nIf we are writing a plain old ruby method, it would be preferable to say something like this\n\n    def foo(user)\n      return false unless user.is_a?(User)\n      ...\n\nRather than to rely on type checking that argument before each call. (This wouldn't be very DRY).\n\n    foo(user) if user.is_a?(User)\n\n\nI can do this in ruby, and in controllers, and in models, and view helpers, but not in mailers. It feels off.\nIf I pass in incorrect values to my mailer, even if I know they are incorrect, that mail is destined to be rendered (into an error) whether I like it or not. \n\nI would like a standard way to exit a mailer without generating mail. If another implementation might be considered, (such as supporting an early return) let me know and I can work on a PR. Or if we should use some other pattern, let me know and I can add it to the Mailer guide.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fe4dbd3543c15100bcf5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7202#issuecomment-7804544"}
