{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7202", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks for the reply, I didn't notice the \"Revert\" commit attached. It feels wrong to me that I need to keep the responsibility of checking my arguments to my mailers outside of the methods. \n\nIf we are writing a plain old ruby method, it would be preferable to say something like this\n\n    def foo(user)\n      return false unless user.is_a?(User)\n      ...\n\nRather than to rely on type checking that argument before each call. (This wouldn't be very DRY).\n\n    foo(user) if user.is_a?(User)\n\n\nI can do this in ruby, and in controllers, and in models, and view helpers, but not in mailers. It feels off.\nIf I pass in incorrect values to my mailer, even if I know they are incorrect, that mail is destined to be rendered (into an error) whether I like it or not. \n\nI would like a standard way to exit a mailer without generating mail. If another implementation might be considered, (such as supporting an early return) let me know and I can work on a PR. Or if we should use some other pattern, let me know and I can add it to the Mailer guide.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fe4dbd3543c15100bcf5"}, "issue_id": 7202, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7804544", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7202#issuecomment-7804544", "updated_at": "2012-08-17T01:11:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems", "login": "schneems", "gravatar_id": "db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e", "html_url": "https://github.com/schneems", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ef42a6eab211ddd71ac423a80b42d15.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 59744, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-17T01:11:23Z", "id": 7804544, "owner": "rails"}
