The logic would work like this:\r\n\r\n- If only `secret_token` is set: upgrade from the old signed session cookies to the new signed session cookies.\r\n- If only `secret_key_base` is set: use the new encrypted session cookies.\r\n- If both `secret_token` and `secret_key_base` are set: upgrade from old signed cookies to encrypted cookies.\r\n\r\nYou would still be able to use `cookies[:signed]` just as before without warnings, though. The only deprecation warning is the one from here: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/application.rb#L139-L141 that's triggered by not setting `secret_key_base`.
