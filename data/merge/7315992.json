This commit fails to do this.\n\nUnless there's a reason why all these options are not passed to included associations, I'll provide a more general patch with tests... at least I'll try ;)", "_id": {"$oid": "523e03a5bd354364b900c6f1"}, "issue_id": 7184, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7315992", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7184#issuecomment-7315992", "updated_at": "2012-07-27T20:55:41Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anthonyalberto/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anthonyalberto/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anthonyalberto/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anthonyalberto/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/anthonyalberto", "login": "anthonyalberto", "gravatar_id": "80500f94bd85e8508f297a407c679b08", "html_url": "https://github.com/anthonyalberto", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anthonyalberto/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anthonyalberto/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anthonyalberto/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/80500f94bd85e8508f297a407c679b08?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd48b745cc53e68dd14363b1121ce2a02.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anthonyalberto/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 872409, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/anthonyalberto/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-27T20:55:41Z", "id": 7315992, "owner": "rails"}
