However, Ruby's own `Date` formatters always return Monday as `1`, even if you specify Monday as the start of the week. Changing the formatter only influences whether Sunday should equal `0` or `7` (as required by `Date.commercial` and other calendar week based methods).\n\n    d = DateTime.parse(\"Sun, 15 Jul 2012 12:00:00 +0000\")\n\n    # Sunday is the start of the week\n    # Sunday: 0\n    # Monday: 1\n    d.wday\n      => 0\n    d.strftime(\"%w\").to_i  # %w - Day of the week (Sunday is 0, 0..6)\n      => 0\n\n    # Monday is the start of the week\n    # Sunday: 7\n    # Monday: 1\n    d.cwday\n      => 7\n    d.strftime(\"%u\").to_i  # %u - Day of the week (Monday is 1, 1..7)\n      => 7\nFurthermore, I18n expects Sunday to be 0.\n\n    I18n.t 'date.day_names'\n      => [\"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\"]\n\nIMHO, `Date::DAYS_INTO_WEEK` needs to go, or at least be reconciled with Ruby's notion of the index of days.
