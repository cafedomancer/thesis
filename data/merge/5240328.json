Just because the documentation says so does not mean that it's behaviour people expect.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure people will be able to deal with it, though.\r\n\r\n> If someone specced an API function named \"does_x\" but the documentation states that it does not actually do x, I don't think people would be okay with that.\r\n\r\nI get your point and why you make the comparison, but it\u2019s not the same in this case, _seen from a different point of view_. A Ruby predicate method that does not return `true` or `false` still works, as long as truthy/falsey (is that\u2019s what a non-truthy values is called??) values is returned.\r\n\r\n> If it's basic human rights we're talking about, then why isn't it already legal? Why are there protests around it? It's good to know that Rails is not that different to real life politics.\r\n\r\nIt is legal where I\u2019m from :)\r\n\r\nBut, wether or not it is or isn\u2019t legal in some countries does not make it any less of a human rights issue. This issue on the other hand is about opinion. Sometimes that means we have to agree to disagree, but in such a case the owners of a project will have to make the final call.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I have disagreed with many things in Rails in the past and probably will in the future, but a project like Rails simply can\u2019t make progress by not taking an opinionated stance and saying \u2018no\u2019 sometimes.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238159dbd3543c15100dd2b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5582#issuecomment-5240328"}
