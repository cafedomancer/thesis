{"body": "I've just got bitten by an error in the console while looking into another issue:\n\n```ruby\n>> a = []\n=> []\n>> a[a.length - 1] = 'last!'\nIndexError: index -1 too small for array; minimum: 0\n\tfrom (irb):32:in `[]='\n```\n\nAs you can see, Ruby also uses the `' pattern in this case. That said, I think we're good with the current structure.\n\nWith that in mind, I think that the second message `Cannot build association #{association_name}` could be improved to look like the others, right? If you want to do that, please let us know, otherwise I'll close the issue.
