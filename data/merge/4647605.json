{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5153", "repo": "rails", "body": "I think the destiny of  ```offset()```,   ```first()``` and ```last()``` should be bound, and I agree with you that ordering by id when no order is given is a very convenient approach but I wonder if it won't be a dramatic loss in performance (especially for ```first()``` which is virtually the only other way than ```find()``` to get a single record ). If the performance loss is real, then a warning should be issued IMHO.\r\n\r\nabout the ```take()```, please do not make the return type based on the parameter value : it will be the hell to use. It's probably better not to do anything than to name it like the ```Enumerable#take``` and make it behave differently.\r\n\r\nThere is still a need for a method which would extract a single record from the relation without ordering it : I like both ```single()``` and ```one()``` but since  this will be a method used very often, I would go for the shorter ```one()```\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138de"}, "issue_id": 5153, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4647605", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4647605", "updated_at": "2012-03-22T20:30:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho", "login": "Systho", "gravatar_id": "ae62505fba91b9ae398bbd84554a21b9", "html_url": "https://github.com/Systho", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ae62505fba91b9ae398bbd84554a21b9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9a08173505ddb28ef127627901de2918.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 47462, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-22T20:29:32Z", "id": 4647605, "owner": "rails"}
