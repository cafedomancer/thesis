{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2287", "repo": "rails", "body": "I am puzzled. This commit shows two diffs, yet shows only a single file in the github viewer. My intention was to also include the following directory by committing a .empty_directory file:\r\nhttps://github.com/dgeb/rails/tree/3-1-mailers-in-plugins/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/plugin_new/templates/app/mailers\r\n\r\nThe reason I wanted to include this directory is that it's apparently missing from:\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/tree/3-1-stable/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/plugin_new/templates/app\r\n\r\nI don't know why this directory and .empty_directory file seem to be missing from this commit. Perhaps it's there and there is a glitch in the github viewer? \r\n\r\nAnyway, the point is that this needs to get into 3-1-stable so that the full app structure is available for new plugins.
