Ideally, it should show just 28b32df. That said, it should be easy enough for @rafaelfranca or whoever merges to just cherry-pick that.\r\n\r\nNormally, you'd do something like this. I'm assuming `upstream` is pointing at `rails/rails.git`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git fetch upstream\r\n$ git checkout master\r\n$ git rebase upstream/master\r\n$ git rebase -i\r\n\r\n< choose squash for all of your commits>\r\n\r\n$ git push origin master -f\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it's often good to make patches against a new branch, and not your master; this only matters if you submit two pulls at once, which can happen since pulls sit for a month or two at times. :)\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523dc172bd354364b9009bad"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7871#issuecomment-9379795"}
