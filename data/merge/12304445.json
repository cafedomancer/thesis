{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8704", "repo": "rails", "body": "The only problem I've found is if a trailing slash is meant to be part of the query string, such as \"?spareslashes=////\" where I expect the value of spareslashes to be \"////\". I can't really think of a reason someone would do this (maybe putting another path to redirect to later?), but it seems RFC 3986 allows it (specifically section 3.4... \"The characters slash (\"/\") and question mark (\"?\") may represent data within the query component.\"). If this is the case it would seem that the slash could conceivably come at the end of a query string somehow. What does everyone think?\r\n\r\nI've added this as a failing test case here: timraymond@a18cc780c31aff0194e1b8c6cf6ade92fadb71db", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f0bcbd3543c15100a33e"}, "issue_id": 8704, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12304445", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8704#issuecomment-12304445", "updated_at": "2013-01-16T04:29:50Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timraymond/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timraymond/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timraymond/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timraymond/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/timraymond", "login": "timraymond", "gravatar_id": "92166968481531ecd4eded36908c3e8f", "html_url": "https://github.com/timraymond", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timraymond/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timraymond/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timraymond/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/92166968481531ecd4eded36908c3e8f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F1358a214520fbf428bb48ee189076ef6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timraymond/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 288061, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/timraymond/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-16T04:29:50Z", "id": 12304445, "owner": "rails"}
