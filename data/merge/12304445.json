I can't really think of a reason someone would do this (maybe putting another path to redirect to later?), but it seems RFC 3986 allows it (specifically section 3.4... \"The characters slash (\"/\") and question mark (\"?\") may represent data within the query component.\"). If this is the case it would seem that the slash could conceivably come at the end of a query string somehow. What does everyone think?\r\n\r\nI've added this as a failing test case here: timraymond@a18cc780c31aff0194e1b8c6cf6ade92fadb71db", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f0bcbd3543c15100a33e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8704#issuecomment-12304445"}
