{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10010", "repo": "rails", "body": "The change looks ok, and Rails code would probably break when [this condition will be removed in the future](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/schema_statements.rb#L769). But the test redefining a method and checking if the options have arrived as a hash seems slightly brittle. It'd be good if we could ensure that sending `nil` would break somewhere else, focusing more on the behavior itself, but I don't have any good example coming to my mind right now.
