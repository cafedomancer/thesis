It is an `ensure` block not a `rescue` block, that's why I think my original version with the `&& !digest` was a bit too clever for its own good. Please change it like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrescue Exception\r\n  @@cache.delete_pair(cache_key, false) if pre_stored # make sure not to corrupt the @@cache\r\n  raise\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, there is no point in checking `digest` for \"presence\" (the original code was doing it as a clever trick to detect an exception throw in an `ensure` block). You can go back to the plain:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n@@cache[cache_key] = digest if ActionView::Resolver.caching?\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d15ebd3543c151007dc2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11768#issuecomment-22189954"}
