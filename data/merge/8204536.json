{"body": "> I am not sure why #destroy does not reset the session. It claims to, and following the trail of code, looks like it does. But it doesn't. Anybody have any ideas?\n\nMy guess is that it's a bug in the test framework.  Can you try generating an app and testing with real requests and responses?  I'll bet that the id does get reset IRL, but that the test framework is reusing objects or something.  I know for a fact the test framework is reusing requests and response objects, and that *may* impact this test.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8204536", "created_at": "2012-08-31T20:46:49Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7495#issuecomment-8204536", "updated_at": "2012-08-31T20:47:58Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7495, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tenderlove", "type": "User", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fb04bd3543c15100b726"}, "id": 8204536, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7495"}
