{"body": "yep, this patch is fixing something we fixed slightly differnetly in 3-2-stable already, but master had diverged at that point, and is something I'm running into too. \n\nI don't completely understand the intended semantics of this patch, exactly what it's intended to fix how. But let me know if I can help, I'm becoming increasingly familiar with ConnectionPool's concurrency semantics (somewhat sadly :) ). \n\nHave you really managed to enforce \"fairness\" so when threads are waiting on a connection, it's first-in/first-out?  I can't quite figure out how your code does that, but I'm impressed if it does, I've been racking my brain and unable to come up with any way to do that with ruby's own mutex semantics. \n\nPlease let me know if/how I can help get this resolved (I'm interested in back-porting to 3.2.x, even if only in my own personal monkey patches, once it's in master.
