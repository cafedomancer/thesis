There's nothing _file-wise_ in stdlib that doesn't exist in the gem.\r\n\r\nAs far as test/unit goes... that's an ongoing pain of mine and mostly out of my hands. It mostly falls down to stdlib not being proper gems but instead pretending. It causes all sorts of loading hell. I addressed this as best I could by making the stdlib minitest/autorun activate the gem so if you did have a real minitest gem installed you'd immediately switch over to it. That's in place across all the 1.9.3 series and up (at least... might go back to 1.9.2). \r\n\r\nMT5 does _not_ have anything to sabotage the use of test/unit. That was intentional as I'm fucking tired of getting flack from people who don't even bother understanding what's going on in the first place before they start flinging their poo.\r\n\r\nI did have some code in MT that would warn if it saw both minitest and test/unit constants but I only used that in debug mode to ensure I finished porting my old tests over. Pretty easy to put something in AS::TC if you think that'd help mitigate confusion.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237de00bd3543c151008b90"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10527#issuecomment-17712777"}
