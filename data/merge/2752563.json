Ideally we'd have a single module that we can just throw methods into wherever in Active Record they get generated. As you said, the attributes stuff already generates methods in its own module. There's also stuff like nested attributes, composed_of, etc, that all generate methods, and would all benefit from this sort of change in the future.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if you could incorporate into your patch a change that defines a method on `ActiveRecord::Base` which generates/includes this module (like the `generated_attribute_methods` method in `ActiveModel::AttributeMethods`). Then, we could redefine `generated_attribute_methods` in AR to reference this module also.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you can generate this module in such a way that it is a named constant, so that it's obvious what it is when people inspect `Model.ancestors`.\r\n\r\nPlease also add a CHANGELOG entry for this.\r\n\r\nIt would also be great to add to the docs to indicate to users that they can extend the generated methods using super.", "_id": {"$oid": "523f5c6ebd354364b901742f"}, "issue_id": 3636, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2752563", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3636#issuecomment-2752563", "updated_at": "2011-11-15T22:33:55Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "login": "jonleighton", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-15T22:33:55Z", "id": 2752563, "owner": "rails"}
