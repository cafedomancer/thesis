A specification uses natural language and thus it is subject to the ambiguities of natural language. A RFC is not expressed in the formal language of mathematical logic, so you will agree with me certainly that there may be room for interpretation in some places. This is a case in point.\r\n\r\nRFC 2616 says \"The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.\". Now almost everyone on planet Earth reads there *creation* or *replacement*. Since this is formulated in English some minority (to which you seem to belong) argue that it is ambiguous and that *your* interpretation leaves room for partial updates in that sentence.\r\n\r\nOK, a way to settle that? Have the person whose name appears first in the list of authors of RFC 2616 tell us what it means. It means creation or replacement. Period (as he puts it).\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c7ebd3543c15100e4d3"}, "issue_id": 5130, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4193626", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5130#issuecomment-4193626", "updated_at": "2012-02-27T13:50:25Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-02-27T13:46:25Z", "id": 4193626, "owner": "rails"}
