Just if it is a regression between 3.2.8 and 3.2.9.\r\n\r\nWe will merge in 3-2-stable but it will only be available only for 3.2.10. You don't need to update your application for 4.0 to get this fix.\r\n\r\nWe need to wait the final release of 3.2.9 to merge this one.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f5a5bd3543c15100ac72"}, "issue_id": 8138, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10158383", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8138#issuecomment-10158383", "updated_at": "2012-11-07T18:04:19Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca", "login": "rafaelfranca", "gravatar_id": "0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03", "html_url": "https://github.com/rafaelfranca", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2c7b84fa30f0cea96a90729afe2970a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 47848, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-07T18:04:19Z", "id": 10158383, "owner": "rails"}
