{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5339", "repo": "rails", "body": "This adds to the feeling that Date already knows too much about Week. For the original usage, we really wanted `#previous_monday` to get the beginning of the work week, not the calendar week. As far as I know, `#end_of_week` was only added for symmetry.\n\nThis PR seems like a natural step, in keeping with the rest of the API, but the added complexity here makes it clear that handling weeks & calendaring in `Date` needs rethinking too. A new Rails-wide setting, default attr, and thread-local all to track calendar week config, all on `Date` itself. Begging for a separate `Week`.\n\nThat said, this seems a fine addition for now. I wouldn't know what `config.week_start` means without reading documentation, so perhaps that should be something clearer, like `config.beginning_of_week = :sunday`.", "_id": {"$oid": "523eca8fbd354364b9012d63"}, "issue_id": 5339, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8514854", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5339#issuecomment-8514854", "updated_at": "2012-09-13T00:29:02Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy", "login": "jeremy", "gravatar_id": "24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremy", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84d9ee44e457ddef7f2c4f25dc8fa865.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 199, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-13T00:29:02Z", "id": 8514854, "owner": "rails"}
