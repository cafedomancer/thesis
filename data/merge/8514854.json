For the original usage, we really wanted `#previous_monday` to get the beginning of the work week, not the calendar week. As far as I know, `#end_of_week` was only added for symmetry.\n\nThis PR seems like a natural step, in keeping with the rest of the API, but the added complexity here makes it clear that handling weeks & calendaring in `Date` needs rethinking too. A new Rails-wide setting, default attr, and thread-local all to track calendar week config, all on `Date` itself. Begging for a separate `Week`.\n\nThat said, this seems a fine addition for now. I wouldn't know what `config.week_start` means without reading documentation, so perhaps that should be something clearer, like `config.beginning_of_week = :sunday`.", "_id": {"$oid": "523eca8fbd354364b9012d63"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5339#issuecomment-8514854"}
