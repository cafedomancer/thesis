Surely you don't close a db connection when a thread dies, and open a new one for a new thread, right? That would be silly, and really make a 'pool' pointless, the point is not closing and re-opening db connections all the time. So perhaps you are suggesting that after a thread checks out a connection, the thread can't check that connection in until the thread dies? That doesn't make much sense either.  So I'm not quite sure what you mean). ", "_id": {"$oid": "5238182abd3543c15100e013"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5423#issuecomment-4490024"}
