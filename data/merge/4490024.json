{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5423", "repo": "rails", "body": "(I'm also wondering if what you said can really possibly be true.  Surely you don't close a db connection when a thread dies, and open a new one for a new thread, right? That would be silly, and really make a 'pool' pointless, the point is not closing and re-opening db connections all the time. So perhaps you are suggesting that after a thread checks out a connection, the thread can't check that connection in until the thread dies? That doesn't make much sense either.  So I'm not quite sure what you mean).
