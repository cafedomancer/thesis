But could you please send this request to Rails mailing list and get feedback from more people?\r\n\r\nAt first, I am -1 on this feature. Rails has_many :through, without being nested, already have a few limitations that I really would like to see fixed before adding more complexity. For example, in the case \"User has many groups through subscriptions\", the following does not work:\r\n\r\n    group = user.groups.build\r\n    group.save\r\n\r\nAs it does not save the associated object subscriptions. Calling .create() works as expected though. The lack of the ability to support a dependent option (like :destroy, :delete) for the associated record is also another limitation (currently we have dangling records). We can find others examples in LH.", "_id": {"$oid": "523869a8bd3543c151012aa0"}, "issue_id": 121, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/572582", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/121#issuecomment-572582", "updated_at": "2010-11-29T10:31:06Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2010-11-29T10:31:06Z", "id": 572582, "owner": "rails"}
