But could you please send this request to Rails mailing list and get feedback from more people?\r\n\r\nAt first, I am -1 on this feature. Rails has_many :through, without being nested, already have a few limitations that I really would like to see fixed before adding more complexity. For example, in the case \"User has many groups through subscriptions\", the following does not work:\r\n\r\n    group = user.groups.build\r\n    group.save\r\n\r\nAs it does not save the associated object subscriptions. Calling .create() works as expected though. The lack of the ability to support a dependent option (like :destroy, :delete) for the associated record is also another limitation (currently we have dangling records). We can find others examples in LH.", "_id": {"$oid": "523869a8bd3543c151012aa0"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/121#issuecomment-572582"}
