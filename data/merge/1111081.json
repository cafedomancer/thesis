I think this is not required because you can say --skip-active-record because you want to use Datamapper. Setting it to false will likely override the Datamapper setting. :( Maybe we should just change config.generators.orm and config.generators.test_framework inside railties/ to have a default of false, this way, if no activerecord, testunit or any other orm/test framework are available, it will automatically skip them. What do you think?", "_id": {"$oid": "52386090bd3543c15101228b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/414#issuecomment-1111081"}
