The test is really testing what happens when you don't check back in the `conn` as required -- with no assignment it's a lot less clear what's going on. But I can do that if you think!\n\nOthers all make sense.  Can you give me any guide or hint as to how I fix the pull request to incorporate those changes? New commit in same branch? Rebase in same branch?  I know it does not need to be a new pull request, but am not sure the right way do it. Thanks very much for any hints.
