Should I add a comment saying what the table is for?\r\n\r\n@rafaelfranca I was hoping to backport this to 3-2-stable, like I did for #6328 / #6418. Should I add the entry to the CHANGELOG there? I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong by the way, I thought bug fixes should first be applied to master and then backported, but I'm not sure how well that works for the CHANGELOG.\r\n\r\nThank you for your guidance!", "_id": {"$oid": "523d9e92bd354364b900853d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8276#issuecomment-10559320"}
