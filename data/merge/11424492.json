A few notes:\r\n\r\n> Currently, the tracker is chosen based on the template handler, which should roughly correspond to the template language. I'd like a better way of looking up trackers, e.g. by having each Template know its \"language\".\r\n\r\nThe current solution is fine, except that I would register it to `:erb` and not the handler class. We could also possibly allow more than one tracker per extension.\r\n\r\n> Another question is whether the dependency tracker should default to the ErbTracker, which perhaps should be renamed.\r\n\r\nThe name is fine except I would call it ERBTracker for consistency with the template handler.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure what level of support there is for non-Erb templating languages in Digestor right now.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is any.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d8483bd354364b9007713"}, "issue_id": 8530, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11424492", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8530#issuecomment-11424492", "updated_at": "2012-12-16T23:11:36Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-16T23:11:36Z", "id": 11424492, "owner": "rails"}
