A few notes:\r\n\r\n> Currently, the tracker is chosen based on the template handler, which should roughly correspond to the template language. I'd like a better way of looking up trackers, e.g. by having each Template know its \"language\".\r\n\r\nThe current solution is fine, except that I would register it to `:erb` and not the handler class. We could also possibly allow more than one tracker per extension.\r\n\r\n> Another question is whether the dependency tracker should default to the ErbTracker, which perhaps should be renamed.\r\n\r\nThe name is fine except I would call it ERBTracker for consistency with the template handler.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure what level of support there is for non-Erb templating languages in Digestor right now.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is any.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d8483bd354364b9007713"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8530#issuecomment-11424492"}
