I found that this change can cause issues if you add timestamps to a join table like below:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass AddTagsPostssJoinTable < ActiveRecord::Migration\r\n  def change\r\n    create_table :tags_posts, :id => false do |t|\r\n      t.references :tag\r\n      t.references :post\r\n      t.timestamps\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe easy solution is to just remove the timestamps from this table, as they don't really add anything.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5238378fbd3543c15100fe96"}, "issue_id": 3334, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4598202", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3334#issuecomment-4598202", "updated_at": "2012-03-20T15:44:56Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hkarthik/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hkarthik/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hkarthik/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hkarthik/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hkarthik", "login": "hkarthik", "gravatar_id": "379092b7595a0443774ae310b5fd9ce8", "html_url": "https://github.com/hkarthik", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hkarthik/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hkarthik/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hkarthik/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/379092b7595a0443774ae310b5fd9ce8?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbdee1222aa8aea187047aebe990fa6e7.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hkarthik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 131488, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hkarthik/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-20T15:44:56Z", "id": 4598202, "owner": "rails"}
