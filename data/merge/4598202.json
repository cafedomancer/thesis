I found that this change can cause issues if you add timestamps to a join table like below:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass AddTagsPostssJoinTable < ActiveRecord::Migration\r\n  def change\r\n    create_table :tags_posts, :id => false do |t|\r\n      t.references :tag\r\n      t.references :post\r\n      t.timestamps\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe easy solution is to just remove the timestamps from this table, as they don't really add anything.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5238378fbd3543c15100fe96"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3334#issuecomment-4598202"}
