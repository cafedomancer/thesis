There were also special cases where `distinct: true` did not work. For example PostgreSQL allows you to do a distinct on multiple columns:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(name, email)) FROM members;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's better to let the user know that he can specify the exact count clause than abstracting that away with the `distunct: true` option.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nMember.count(\"DISTINCT(name, email)\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso the `Relation#distinct` method is there to be combined with `select\u00b4:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPerson.select(\"name\").distinct.count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThose two avenues provide a more complete API and there is no more need to keep the third option (passing `distinct: true`) around.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d164abd354364b90047c8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9683#issuecomment-22893614"}
