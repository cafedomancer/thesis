{"body": "I can give you two example of irrational behavior of today ```extract!```\n\n```\nparams = {:a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3, :d => 4}\nx = params.extract!(:x)\nx.empty? ? 'OK' : x\n#  => {:x=>nil} \n```\n\nAnd, if you think too, that above output is irrational, here is another example\n\n```\nsome_AR_model.name # 'James'\nparams = {:a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3, :d => 4}\nsome_AR_model.update_attributes(params.extract!(:name))\nsome_AR_model.name # nil\n```\n\nI think in the second example more rational is to not touch ```name``` attribute, because it's absent in original ```params``` hash", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6840501", "created_at": "2012-07-09T07:53:50Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7007#issuecomment-6840501", "updated_at": "2012-07-09T07:53:50Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7007, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mik-die/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mik-die/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mik-die/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mik-die", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mik-die/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/Mik-die", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mik-die/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7d116b912a4fc7986b40d5d0d0d811d6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa587d6b5be4a306d5b73620593d05627.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mik-die/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mik-die/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7d116b912a4fc7986b40d5d0d0d811d6", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mik-die/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "Mik-die", "type": "User", "id": 426230, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Mik-die/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e1211bd354364b900d07e"}, "id": 6840501, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7007"}
