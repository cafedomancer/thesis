My scenario is as follows:\n\n* User is an abstract model with two subclasses, Student and Professor\n* UsersController is a resourceful controller used to edit either a Student or Professor (depending on who is logged in)\n\n```ruby\n# app/models/user.rb\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  self.abstract_class = true\nend\n\n# app/controllers/users_controller.rb\nclass UsersController < ApplicationController\nend\n\n# config/initializers/wrap_parameters.rb\nActionController::Base.wrap_parameters :format => [:json]\n```\n\nLet me know if there is anything I should do on top of this comment.", "_id": {"$oid": "52403b74bd354364b90209e6"}, "issue_id": 359, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1160382", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/359#issuecomment-1160382", "updated_at": "2011-05-14T03:52:40Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin", "login": "agrobbin", "gravatar_id": "571fa6cb5179c2a25b3414a344611bb2", "html_url": "https://github.com/agrobbin", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/571fa6cb5179c2a25b3414a344611bb2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F52f1872a9c47b688089e8816ba9b1d9d.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 46724, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-14T03:52:24Z", "id": 1160382, "owner": "rails"}
