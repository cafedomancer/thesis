{"body": "This is my first post for the Rails core, so please tell me if I'm posting this in the wrong spot or should be doing something differently..\n\nAfter working with Rails 3.1.0beta, I found there be a problem with the ActionController::ParamsWrapper when dealing with a abstract class and a similarly named controller. My scenario is as follows:\n\n* User is an abstract model with two subclasses, Student and Professor\n* UsersController is a resourceful controller used to edit either a Student or Professor (depending on who is logged in)\n\n```ruby\n# app/models/user.rb\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  self.abstract_class = true\nend\n\n# app/controllers/users_controller.rb\nclass UsersController < ApplicationController\nend\n\n# config/initializers/wrap_parameters.rb\nActionController::Base.wrap_parameters :format => [:json]\n```\n\nLet me know if there is anything I should do on top of this comment.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1160382", "created_at": "2011-05-14T03:52:24Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/359#issuecomment-1160382", "updated_at": "2011-05-14T03:52:40Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 359, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/agrobbin", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/571fa6cb5179c2a25b3414a344611bb2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F52f1872a9c47b688089e8816ba9b1d9d.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/received_events", "gravatar_id": "571fa6cb5179c2a25b3414a344611bb2", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "agrobbin", "type": "User", "id": 46724, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/agrobbin/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52403b74bd354364b90209e6"}, "id": 1160382, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/359"}
