I've updated gist with `ab` test against edge master (b77f25cb8479a8ff6c93b1d6bbf0771e5368434f) and to me they're a bit un unexpected: https://gist.github.com/strzalek/6293709\r\n\r\nI haven't thought that my branch would be **that** faster. I've thought that there will be no difference or it'll be even a bit slower. Maybe my tests are too dumb and simple? What do you think? If not, those changes will introduce quite big performance gain! :spades: ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/23186946", "created_at": "2013-08-23T19:47:17Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11396#issuecomment-23186946", "updated_at": "2013-08-23T19:47:46Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 11396, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/strzalek", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e28434223c9c5d2ee0d7f7b7c887b36a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F673de96b04fa3adcae1aacda704217ef.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e28434223c9c5d2ee0d7f7b7c887b36a", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "strzalek", "type": "User", "id": 11562, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523c79f6bd354364b90010b6"}, "id": 23186946, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11396"}
