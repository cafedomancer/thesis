{"body": "@arunagw oh, thank you! It caused problems with `raw`\nit is happening due to forced sanitizing. I see two ways to go - do not mark returned string as html_safe - then you can ```raw``` it or `sanitize`\nOr, more simple way to go(and more secure by architecture) - rollback and hardcode(whitelist) possible protocols. \nI'm talking about\n```\n        AUTO_LINK_RE = %r{\n            (?: ([\\w+.:-]+:)// | www\\. )\n            [^\\s<]+\n          }x\n```\nwe will whitelist that ```([\\w+.:-]+:)``` part using  https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_controller/vendor/html-scanner/html/sanitizer.rb#L100 in rails_autolink and in 3-0-stable\n\n@tenderlove how do you like the solution?
