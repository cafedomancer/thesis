I see two ways to go - do not mark returned string as html_safe - then you can ```raw``` it or `sanitize`\nOr, more simple way to go(and more secure by architecture) - rollback and hardcode(whitelist) possible protocols. \nI'm talking about\n```\n        AUTO_LINK_RE = %r{\n            (?: ([\\w+.:-]+:)// | www\\. )\n            [^\\s<]+\n          }x\n```\nwe will whitelist that ```([\\w+.:-]+:)``` part using  https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_controller/vendor/html-scanner/html/sanitizer.rb#L100 in rails_autolink and in 3-0-stable\n\n@tenderlove how do you like the solution? Whitelisting is always safe option to choose in my opinion.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238078cbd3543c15100caf5"}, "issue_id": 6485, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5942065", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6485#issuecomment-5942065", "updated_at": "2012-05-25T22:50:43Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov", "login": "homakov", "gravatar_id": "d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d", "html_url": "https://github.com/homakov", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc1464ded796adc7ac65355e3cc0df165.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 174693, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-25T22:48:43Z", "id": 5942065, "owner": "rails"}
