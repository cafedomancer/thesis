By shelling out with `--dry-run` we're guaranteeing that it is a valid task and available to the system. How would you feel if I took out the timeout and auto-run feature and just displayed a message instead (keeping in the system check to see if the command exists)?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7e0bd3543c15100b14e"}, "issue_id": 7891, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9323762", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7891#issuecomment-9323762", "updated_at": "2012-10-10T23:39:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems", "login": "schneems", "gravatar_id": "db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e", "html_url": "https://github.com/schneems", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ef42a6eab211ddd71ac423a80b42d15.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 59744, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-10T23:39:15Z", "id": 9323762, "owner": "rails"}
