By shelling out with `--dry-run` we're guaranteeing that it is a valid task and available to the system. How would you feel if I took out the timeout and auto-run feature and just displayed a message instead (keeping in the system check to see if the command exists)?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7e0bd3543c15100b14e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7891#issuecomment-9323762"}
