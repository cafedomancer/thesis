{"body": "Strong Prameters does not solve the problem of checking parameters in Rails. The problem is model-based validation.\n\nRequire or not require, permit or not permit, validate and how to validate - these are questions of the Form, not of a model and *not of a controller*.\n\nModel-based validation must be like SQL constraints - simple, basic and unconditional. It's about solidity of data, it's about consistency, not roles or permissions.\n\nAnd `params` are form-specific, not of controller. They can be used with different models, presenters and controllers.\n\nOne form can require `:password`, another one require `:email`, another one require `:full_name` and permit to another field.\n\nAnother problem with StrongParameters - they ara introduce duplication of responsibilities:\n\n```\nparams.require(:user) # in controller\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nvalidates :user, :presence => true # model\n```\n\nWhat is difference between these approaches?\n\n# Resolution\n\nChecking parameters (validation, requirements etc) must be extracted to the dedicated class.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8822657", "created_at": "2012-09-24T15:25:33Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7251#issuecomment-8822657", "updated_at": "2012-09-24T15:25:33Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7251, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dapi/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dapi/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dapi/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dapi", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dapi/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/dapi", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dapi/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2acd6312f73d16ce507b6e7cb7a3d548?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc06debb249d4e75425c7f2c2c9e96a5c.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dapi/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dapi/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2acd6312f73d16ce507b6e7cb7a3d548", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dapi/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "dapi", "type": "User", "id": 31139, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dapi/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523dfc3ebd354364b900c219"}, "id": 8822657, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7251"}
