{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/4396", "repo": "rails", "body": "I don't think it's possible (or desirable) to fix the case where a model has its own table_name_prefix and table_name_suffix, and even if it is, I think this patch should be committed as-is until someone figures out how to do this.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the models aren't even loaded when when database schema is dumped or loaded, so reading individual model classes' table_name_(pre|suf)fix attributes is a non-starter.  Also, having a different prefix on each model is likely the kind of thing that someone will do when they're interfacing with an external database from another application.  In that case, it's unlikely that the user wants those tables to be created anyway.", "_id": {"$oid": "52382743bd3543c15100ef33"}, "issue_id": 4396, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5076121", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4396#issuecomment-5076121", "updated_at": "2012-04-11T18:56:19Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlitz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlitz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlitz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlitz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlitz", "login": "dlitz", "gravatar_id": "902985014db4ed0aeaa0d63aee4d6f22", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlitz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlitz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlitz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlitz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/902985014db4ed0aeaa0d63aee4d6f22?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F30ebbc2df45c4458e95e2f1ee3a8011c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 99377, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlitz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-11T18:56:19Z", "id": 5076121, "owner": "rails"}
