Or were there no tests for functionality that should have had them before and now it fails?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how else to allow the reference to the owner object be set on the new record.  I was looking for a hook somewhere in the creation process to allow the assignment of the owner, but couldn't find one, so passing in the creation attributes is what seemed to work.\r\n\r\nIf somebody with more detailed knowledge of the AR API knows of how to make the association between the owner and the new record, then that should be used.  The AR API between 3.0 and 3.1 changed considerably and this connection between the owner and new record was lost.", "_id": {"$oid": "52382c44bd3543c15100f1c8"}, "issue_id": 4122, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3240908", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4122#issuecomment-3240908", "updated_at": "2011-12-21T22:52:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick", "login": "akaspick", "gravatar_id": "898bf26eb61308fe717a243441cc615d", "html_url": "https://github.com/akaspick", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/898bf26eb61308fe717a243441cc615d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F82c3cf12914d43d34d8883ec88307da2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 24056, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-21T22:52:23Z", "id": 3240908, "owner": "rails"}
