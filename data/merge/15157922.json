I can't think of a good reason for allowing clashing named routes, and raising an exception might save people from subtle issues in their apps. I chatted with @jeremy about this and I think he agrees. \r\n\r\nThat leaves the problem of explaining how a clashing named route may be defined using the `resources` method. This is a bit tricky to explain succinctly, but I've done my best to provide a helpful message while raising the exception. I also updated the CHANGELOG and the Upgrading Guide in an effort to cover all the bases.\r\n\r\nFeedback is more than welcome, of course, but if we agree this all makes sense I think this is ready to merge!", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b9004692"}, "issue_id": 9704, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/15157922", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-15157922", "updated_at": "2013-03-20T04:33:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk", "login": "trevorturk", "gravatar_id": "c0b6fb3807d7d4f255463ed168c75897", "html_url": "https://github.com/trevorturk", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c0b6fb3807d7d4f255463ed168c75897?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F69cb3ea317a32c4e6143e665fdb20b14.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-20T04:33:23Z", "id": 15157922, "owner": "rails"}
