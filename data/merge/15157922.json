I can't think of a good reason for allowing clashing named routes, and raising an exception might save people from subtle issues in their apps. I chatted with @jeremy about this and I think he agrees. \r\n\r\nThat leaves the problem of explaining how a clashing named route may be defined using the `resources` method. This is a bit tricky to explain succinctly, but I've done my best to provide a helpful message while raising the exception. I also updated the CHANGELOG and the Upgrading Guide in an effort to cover all the bases.\r\n\r\nFeedback is more than welcome, of course, but if we agree this all makes sense I think this is ready to merge!", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b9004692"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-15157922"}
