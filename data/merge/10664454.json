Thanks for looking at the issue!\r\n\r\nThe same test case passes against master without any changes to the master AR code. So this issue appears to exist only in 3.2. If you'd like, I can issue a PR against master adding the test case just to make sure the behavior is locked in.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n ", "_id": {"$oid": "523dc9f1bd354364b900a009"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7792#issuecomment-10664454"}
