These strings are the *keys* to the attributes hash, so I don't think we need to worry about users expecting to be able to do something crazy like\n\n```ruby\n  @attributes.keys.map(&:upcase!)\n```\n\nThis seems like a complete no brainer to me, the only change I'd suggest is just interning the strings to symbols but that's something that *could* surprise users.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f9a0bd3543c15100b4b2"}, "issue_id": 7631, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8716467", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7631#issuecomment-8716467", "updated_at": "2012-09-20T04:23:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-20T04:23:29Z", "id": 8716467, "owner": "rails"}
