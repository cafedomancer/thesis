I've added few commits above addressing your comments and small things that I've found myself.\r\n\r\nRegarding the new line at the end of the file - those files are copied as they were before, in actionpack, nothing's been changed there. I guess that adding new line at the end may break some tests? I don't know. Anyway - it's a matter of style and I don't have opinion on that. It's up to core team.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d968bd3543c1510085aa"}, "issue_id": 11032, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/19767781", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11032#issuecomment-19767781", "updated_at": "2013-06-20T17:18:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek", "login": "strzalek", "gravatar_id": "e28434223c9c5d2ee0d7f7b7c887b36a", "html_url": "https://github.com/strzalek", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e28434223c9c5d2ee0d7f7b7c887b36a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F673de96b04fa3adcae1aacda704217ef.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 11562, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/strzalek/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-06-20T17:17:23Z", "id": 19767781, "owner": "rails"}
