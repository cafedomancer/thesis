{"body": "Thanks @robin850 and @rafaelfranca for review. I've added few commits above addressing your comments and small things that I've found myself.\r\n\r\nRegarding the new line at the end of the file - those files are copied as they were before, in actionpack, nothing's been changed there. I guess that adding new line at the end may break some tests? I don't know. Anyway - it's a matter of style and I don't have opinion on that.
