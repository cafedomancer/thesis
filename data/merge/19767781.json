I've added few commits above addressing your comments and small things that I've found myself.\r\n\r\nRegarding the new line at the end of the file - those files are copied as they were before, in actionpack, nothing's been changed there. I guess that adding new line at the end may break some tests? I don't know. Anyway - it's a matter of style and I don't have opinion on that. It's up to core team.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d968bd3543c1510085aa"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11032#issuecomment-19767781"}
