For the same reason, I think that 'resource' is a bad idea, but I am still interested in hearing what its proponents have to say.\r\n\r\nOut of the three alternatives above, I prefer 'system', and I think it is a good name since the tests exercise the system that I'm building, albeit not necessarily the system of which this project might be a part.  If we haven't reached the point of a formal vote, I would like to add another option: \"story tests\".  They do, after all, test stories.  But only if you work in stories, of course.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7febd3543c15100b19e"}, "issue_id": 7878, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9279477", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7878#issuecomment-9279477", "updated_at": "2012-10-09T20:55:38Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dvrensk/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dvrensk/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dvrensk/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dvrensk/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dvrensk", "login": "dvrensk", "gravatar_id": "94952ae2519ff1b9b5d982863bcb37f3", "html_url": "https://github.com/dvrensk", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dvrensk/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dvrensk/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dvrensk/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/94952ae2519ff1b9b5d982863bcb37f3?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F050553d40196ef109fff37cbb40aaf28.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dvrensk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 14046, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dvrensk/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-09T20:55:38Z", "id": 9279477, "owner": "rails"}
