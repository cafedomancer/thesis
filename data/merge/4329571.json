I tend to agree with @josevalim; the generator could be modified to add `t.references :user, :index => true` rather than including the extra `add_index` statement. I guess some may still end up forgetting to use `:index => true` when manually using references; that might be fine, or it could give a warning when adding an association without the :index option explicitly defined.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4329571", "created_at": "2012-03-05T19:16:53Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5262#issuecomment-4329571", "updated_at": "2012-03-05T19:16:53Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5262, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuap/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuap/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuap/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuap", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuap/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshuap", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuap/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b7632770a85e03b597b031477c8c24bc?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3b308272ee9b90dd1da640fb4e69e5f3.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuap/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuap/received_events", "gravatar_id": "b7632770a85e03b597b031477c8c24bc", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuap/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "joshuap", "type": "User", "id": 474649, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuap/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ed3aebd354364b90131c1"}, "id": 4329571, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5262"}
