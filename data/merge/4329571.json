I tend to agree with @josevalim; the generator could be modified to add `t.references :user, :index => true` rather than including the extra `add_index` statement. I guess some may still end up forgetting to use `:index => true` when manually using references; that might be fine, or it could give a warning when adding an association without the :index option explicitly defined.", "_id": {"$oid": "523ed3aebd354364b90131c1"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5262#issuecomment-4329571"}
