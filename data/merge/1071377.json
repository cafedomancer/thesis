It's very rare that you will want to build a default scope incrementally rather than just declare it once\r\n2. Having people implement the `default_scope` method gives them the *choice* about how inheritance should work. They can decide whether or not to call `super`.\r\n\r\nThanks", "_id": {"$oid": "523861ddbd3543c15101237b"}, "issue_id": 340, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1071377", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/340#issuecomment-1071377", "updated_at": "2011-04-28T18:35:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "login": "jonleighton", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-28T18:35:37Z", "id": 1071377, "owner": "rails"}
