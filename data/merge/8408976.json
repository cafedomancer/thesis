{"body": "@schneems \n\nJust so everybody is on the same page, the `pg_array_parser` gem is a `C` extension to speed up the parsing of the Postgres array strings. @danmcclain originally wrote it in Ruby and the performance was OK at best. Moving to C for this yielded a significant increase in speed. `pg_array_parser` also supports `JRuby`\n\nSo that being said, there are two options here with trade offs:\n\n1. the `pg_array_parser` components can be integrated into the `pg` and `jdbc-postgres` gems.\n2. put back the Ruby implementation of the array parsing but add to the Guide that `pg_array_parser` should be added in to over ride for better performance. It will only effect people that use the `array` syntax but it will be an extra step.\n\nAm I missing any other potential options?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8408976", "created_at": "2012-09-09T20:32:02Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7547#issuecomment-8408976", "updated_at": "2012-09-09T20:33:42Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7547, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/bcardarella", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ed5f3e2d77dcf44a67efa72e09e9f28f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F47fa1e27cc0c050aaf8f02272045eca0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/received_events", "gravatar_id": "ed5f3e2d77dcf44a67efa72e09e9f28f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "bcardarella", "type": "User", "id": 18524, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ddf91bd354364b900b006"}, "id": 8408976, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7547"}
