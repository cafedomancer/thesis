It seems like the best course of action is to stick with the convention already in use (using predicate methods). Perhaps it's worth discussing the use of the predicates vs. ````respond_to?```` in a separate issue (or later refactoring).\n\nI also agree, that if ````auto_explain_threshold_in_seconds```` is set in the config and the adapter does not support ````explain````, then Rails should warn the user about the mismatch, and skip the ````explain````.\n\nSeems like the first commit c976341, plus a new commit to warn about the mismatch would be enough to get past the bug presented here.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380cb5bd3543c15100d1c4"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6197#issuecomment-5775316"}
