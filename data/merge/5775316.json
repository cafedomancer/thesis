{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6197", "repo": "rails", "body": "@steveklabnik: Yes, new rails apps come with ````auto_explain_threshold_in_seconds```` set, this is what caused the original issue when the adapter didn't support ````explain````.\n\n@fxn thanks for the background on the other predicates used in the adapter code. It seems like the best course of action is to stick with the convention already in use (using predicate methods). Perhaps it's worth discussing the use of the predicates vs. ````respond_to?```` in a separate issue (or later refactoring).\n\nI also agree, that if ````auto_explain_threshold_in_seconds```` is set in the config and the adapter does not support ````explain````, then Rails should warn the user about the mismatch, and skip the ````explain````.\n\nSeems like the first commit c976341, plus a new commit to warn about the mismatch would be enough to get past the bug presented here.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380cb5bd3543c15100d1c4"}, "issue_id": 6197, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5775316", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6197#issuecomment-5775316", "updated_at": "2012-05-17T22:02:36Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikelikesbikes/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikelikesbikes/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikelikesbikes/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikelikesbikes/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikelikesbikes", "login": "mikelikesbikes", "gravatar_id": "2d2a9c3bfceea360733662f5699139e6", "html_url": "https://github.com/mikelikesbikes", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikelikesbikes/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikelikesbikes/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikelikesbikes/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2d2a9c3bfceea360733662f5699139e6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F717f366df46e509426d8eb5a6bbab71f.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikelikesbikes/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 54649, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikelikesbikes/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-17T22:01:30Z", "id": 5775316, "owner": "rails"}
