The problem is, the current `Company` model has both a `type` and a `ruby_type` field. The tests then switch the `inheritance_column` but for both configurations the same model is used. In my opinion this leads to flawed tests and false positives. My test-case passed with the `Company` model because it had an accessor called `type`. To make sure that `inerhitance_column` works as expected I think we need different models.
