But would be nice to hear from @tenderlove and see what's up. \n\nIf you're curious, here is my frankenstein 3.2.x monkey patch approach of your technique, with additional logging added. https://gist.github.com/2875834", "_id": {"$oid": "52380779bd3543c15100cac3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6492#issuecomment-6128292"}
