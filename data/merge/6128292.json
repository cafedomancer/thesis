But would be nice to hear from @tenderlove and see what's up. \n\nIf you're curious, here is my frankenstein 3.2.x monkey patch approach of your technique, with additional logging added. https://gist.github.com/2875834", "_id": {"$oid": "52380779bd3543c15100cac3"}, "issue_id": 6492, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6128292", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6492#issuecomment-6128292", "updated_at": "2012-06-05T15:43:45Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind", "login": "jrochkind", "gravatar_id": "6a13e655e637138f8d571cec3f9cea76", "html_url": "https://github.com/jrochkind", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6a13e655e637138f8d571cec3f9cea76?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd54ea80e1dddb765bab019d4dfe36c23.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 149304, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-05T15:43:45Z", "id": 6128292, "owner": "rails"}
