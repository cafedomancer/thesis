I then set `config.action_controller.asset_host = \"//xxx.s3.amazonaws.com\"`.\r\n\r\nIn Rails 3.2.x it seems a local copy of `manifest.yml` is required even when using a remote asset host (see https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/3577)\r\n\r\nIf Rails 4 looks up `manifest.yml` on the remote asset_host (if set) rather than requiring it locally, then I would no longer need this config.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17681358", "created_at": "2013-05-09T18:34:38Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7702#issuecomment-17681358", "updated_at": "2013-05-09T18:35:49Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7702, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/johnnyshields/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/johnnyshields/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/johnnyshields/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/johnnyshields", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/johnnyshields/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/johnnyshields", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/johnnyshields/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/844c900811ca41c1a193664cda15e813?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F36e7410e19523e17b648b49ad9230d75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/johnnyshields/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/johnnyshields/received_events", "gravatar_id": "844c900811ca41c1a193664cda15e813", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/johnnyshields/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "johnnyshields", "type": "User", "id": 27655, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/johnnyshields/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523dd021bd354364b900a5e8"}, "id": 17681358, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7702"}
