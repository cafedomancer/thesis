I then push my compiled assets to an asset server (Amazon S3), and I push `manifest.yml` to my production web servers. I then set `config.action_controller.asset_host = \"//xxx.s3.amazonaws.com\"`.\r\n\r\nIn Rails 3.2.x it seems a local copy of `manifest.yml` is required even when using a remote asset host (see https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/3577)\r\n\r\nIf Rails 4 looks up `manifest.yml` on the remote asset_host (if set) rather than requiring it locally, then I would no longer need this config.", "_id": {"$oid": "523dd021bd354364b900a5e8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7702#issuecomment-17681358"}
