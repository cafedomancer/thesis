The reality is that there's no way to guarantee that they'll fail as it comes down to non-deterministic behaviour so we could break it again and not have the tests complain at all.\r\n\r\nHowever I'm not sure I see why you don't just use the single mutex rather than introducing this hash subclass.   Without a mutex around clear_stale_cached_connections! there's nothing preventing the method from being called in parallel and while it won't break by mutating a hash in parallel, you probably don't want it to be clearing the cach in two different threads.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385e32bd3543c15101203b"}, "issue_id": 563, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1204690", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/563#issuecomment-1204690", "updated_at": "2011-05-19T16:39:14Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-19T16:39:14Z", "id": 1204690, "owner": "rails"}
