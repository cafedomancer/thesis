{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5261", "repo": "rails", "body": "I would like to note that the 'bug' that #5442 fixes is just how ActiveRecord works. It's possible that having the IdentityMap turned on would extend the scope of the issue, but still not beyond the context of a request. The problem is really how ActiveRecord caches the results of has_many's and belongs_to's without regard to what's going on in the DB.\r\n\r\nThe IdentityMap is a huge improvement to ActiveRecord's memory usage for more complicated actions. Especially those that need to iterate over a collection. The reduction in memory usage in our application is huge with response times improving 3x by just turning the IdentityMap on.", "_id": {"$oid": "523ed417bd354364b9013203"}, "issue_id": 5261, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4574293", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5261#issuecomment-4574293", "updated_at": "2012-03-19T14:28:11Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby", "login": "sskirby", "gravatar_id": "4d4c378e3a10e2d01a636a33c359734c", "html_url": "https://github.com/sskirby", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4d4c378e3a10e2d01a636a33c359734c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6f3e24662182e125fc58299809ee6a67.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 25760, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-19T14:28:11Z", "id": 4574293, "owner": "rails"}
