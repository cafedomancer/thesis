I was giving you a hard time, with the possible outcome of having a scape goat if we decide to break things. ;-)\r\n\r\n@panthomakos I think we're talking about introducing one method: `take`.  The name has no implication of order, and Enumerable implements it too:\r\n\r\n```\r\nirb(main):001:0> [1,2,3,4].take 2\r\n=> [1, 2]\r\nirb(main):002:0>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough I think we should extend it to be similar to `first`, in that `first` can take 0 arguments, but we would have `take` return any particular value from the collection.\r\n\r\n```\r\nirb(main):002:0> [1,2,3,4].first\r\n=> 1\r\nirb(main):003:0> [1,2,3,4].first 2\r\n=> [1, 2]\r\nirb(main):004:0>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it's safe to assume that database tables are unordered lists.  Given that fact, no developer can make assumptions about the return value of either `first` or `last`.  If no developer can make assumptions about the return value, maybe it's OK to order by id with `first`, but emit a warning if no `order` was provided.", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138db"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4644799"}
