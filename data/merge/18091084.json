{"body": "Ah, sorry -- I intended for this to be a Rails 4 change. \r\n\r\nThanks for testing with the engine-defined routes -- I'm glad that wasn't also a problem, but I'm not sure why it wasn't! \r\n\r\nI don't really like the `dont_raise_on_name_conflict` idea, but the \"querying the router to check if a name was already defined\" idea sounds nice. Do you think that's worth investigating? If so, I could give it a shot. If not, I'm tired of arguing about it :wink: If you revert, I think the upgrade guide would go back to explaining the issue, so I think we'd be all set.
