I have corrected `raise` statement. This will raise `RuntimeError` Exception only on MRI & not of JRuby. Tested this against the jruby-head as well, same behaviour. \r\n\r\nfurther, I run my tests using same command, just adding `--client` flag for faster execution:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ jruby -w --client -Ilib:test test/template/digestor_test.rb -n test_top_level_change_reflected\r\n```\r\n\r\n**[Update]**\r\n if you call the class isolated & run it, the `setup` method works as expected. so this behaviour seems to be caused down the stack. \r\nhttps://gist.github.com/gaurish/6151315\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d1a1bd3543c151007df4"}, "issue_id": 11743, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/22076006", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11743#issuecomment-22076006", "updated_at": "2013-08-04T18:22:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish", "login": "gaurish", "gravatar_id": "cb0b42e452cd13d469565a23a8abe441", "html_url": "https://github.com/gaurish", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cb0b42e452cd13d469565a23a8abe441?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F58861ae4fb7b472c95e64685229ad9ed.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 235844, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-08-04T18:11:15Z", "id": 22076006, "owner": "rails"}
