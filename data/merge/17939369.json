The way I've seen it happen is a bunch of code is already using ActiveSupport's JSON interface, a problematic doc comes along, and then the engine is swapped out.  Regardless of the rationale, the point I was raising is that `json` is not a drop-in replacement for other providers but the ActiveSupport interface is going to look the same and as a result code that previously worked no longer will.  My preference is to retain the ability to swap out the engine, whether that be with multi_json or by other means.  But, barring that, I think it's misleading to indicate that a multi_json-like lib is no longer necessary and thus safe to remove. Something in the client app will have to be rewritten and mentioning that in either the CHANGELOG or upgrade guide probably makes sense (admittedly, I don't which one makes the most sense).", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dd7ebd3543c151008b02"}, "issue_id": 10576, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17939369", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10576#issuecomment-17939369", "updated_at": "2013-05-15T13:49:33Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum", "login": "nirvdrum", "gravatar_id": "0f2cc1aefa9529ba8627270cf81d2160", "html_url": "https://github.com/nirvdrum", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/0f2cc1aefa9529ba8627270cf81d2160?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F5cba6e74e996a4b1d7534b6bdc8ee5f6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 12584, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-15T13:49:33Z", "id": 17939369, "owner": "rails"}
