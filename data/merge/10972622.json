{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8404", "repo": "rails", "body": "@pixeltrix thanks for pointing this out. I admit that implementing more closely to what we have in params_filter is a very attractive idea. After all they share similar security concerns, and maybe they should also share some common behaviour in terms of code. That would be more consistent, and less surprising for the user. I realized it while editing the guide. But at the same time this is a tiny change, doing it the other way would probably require to go touch a lot of code, expecially if we want to abstract something out from FilterParameters. @steveklabnik what do you think about this? Would it be better to propose this change in an action_dispatch fashon?
