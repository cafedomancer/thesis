{"body": "@steveklabnik It is.\r\n\r\n@isabanin Sorry I didn't respond, I didn't have a chance to test `:dependent => :nullify`. But I don't think that workaround invalidates the bug/pull request. That is, if you destroy a belongs_to through the association, then the association should be unset. Otherwise you have invalid data being persisted. That should just be default behavior--there shouldn't be a need to have a special option (I don't think the two are equivalent anyway.)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5418491", "created_at": "2012-04-30T14:28:28Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5248#issuecomment-5418491", "updated_at": "2012-04-30T14:28:28Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5248, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jcoleman", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/d8d5058aa91cd439f1f486f93f8eb564?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F518fe206be008d8f98488ba515188a69.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/received_events", "gravatar_id": "d8d5058aa91cd439f1f486f93f8eb564", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jcoleman", "type": "User", "id": 125331, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52381ad8bd3543c15100e366"}, "id": 5418491, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5248"}
