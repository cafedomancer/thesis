But I don't think that workaround invalidates the bug/pull request. That is, if you destroy a belongs_to through the association, then the association should be unset. Otherwise you have invalid data being persisted. That should just be default behavior--there shouldn't be a need to have a special option (I don't think the two are equivalent anyway.)", "_id": {"$oid": "52381ad8bd3543c15100e366"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5248#issuecomment-5418491"}
