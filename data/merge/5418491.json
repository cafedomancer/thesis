But I don't think that workaround invalidates the bug/pull request. That is, if you destroy a belongs_to through the association, then the association should be unset. Otherwise you have invalid data being persisted. That should just be default behavior--there shouldn't be a need to have a special option (I don't think the two are equivalent anyway.)", "_id": {"$oid": "52381ad8bd3543c15100e366"}, "issue_id": 5248, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5418491", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5248#issuecomment-5418491", "updated_at": "2012-04-30T14:28:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman", "login": "jcoleman", "gravatar_id": "d8d5058aa91cd439f1f486f93f8eb564", "html_url": "https://github.com/jcoleman", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/d8d5058aa91cd439f1f486f93f8eb564?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F518fe206be008d8f98488ba515188a69.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 125331, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jcoleman/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-30T14:28:28Z", "id": 5418491, "owner": "rails"}
