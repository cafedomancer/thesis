{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9080", "repo": "rails", "body": "I feel like we do need some way to hook into this. On many projects, I use different frameworks for unit tests, acceptance tests, and JavaScript tests (e.g., rspec/cucumber/jasmine or minitest/cucumber/jasmine). `rake test` can run them all, and it's a command that everyone expects to run all the tests. If `rails test` becomes the new standard, but can't be used for the same situations, I expect things to be more confusing for newcomers and experienced folks alike.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5a22bd354364b9006077"}, "issue_id": 9080, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12739708", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9080#issuecomment-12739708", "updated_at": "2013-01-26T18:31:24Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alindeman", "login": "alindeman", "gravatar_id": "1d41b66ab243250e4268869049dfffc4", "html_url": "https://github.com/alindeman", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/1d41b66ab243250e4268869049dfffc4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6244790ca5b487a04fa497e0cfc1d481.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 395621, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alindeman/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-26T18:31:24Z", "id": 12739708, "owner": "rails"}
