On many projects, I use different frameworks for unit tests, acceptance tests, and JavaScript tests (e.g., rspec/cucumber/jasmine or minitest/cucumber/jasmine). `rake test` can run them all, and it's a command that everyone expects to run all the tests. If `rails test` becomes the new standard, but can't be used for the same situations, I expect things to be more confusing for newcomers and experienced folks alike.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5a22bd354364b9006077"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9080#issuecomment-12739708"}
