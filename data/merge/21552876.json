It looks like `supports_extensions?` may be the better route. There are a number of other extension related methods that probably wouldn't make sense to have defined on the abstract adapter:\r\n\r\n* supports_extensions?\r\n* enable_extension\r\n* disable_extension\r\n* extension_enabled?\r\n* extensions\r\n\r\nThe clearest solution seems like defining `supports_extensions?` on the abstract adapter and hard coding it as false:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef supports_extensions?\r\n  false\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere don't seem to be any tests directly on the `AbstractAdapter`, which makes sense. I'd assert that the sqlite3 adapter does not support extensions:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# activerecord/test/cases/adapters/sqlite3/sqlite3_adapter_test.rb\r\ndef test_supports_extensions\r\n  assert !@conn.support_extensions?, 'does not support extensions'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust my thinking though.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d41bbd3543c151008047"}, "issue_id": 11455, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/21552876", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11455#issuecomment-21552876", "updated_at": "2013-07-25T13:18:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sorentwo/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sorentwo/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sorentwo/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sorentwo/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sorentwo", "login": "sorentwo", "gravatar_id": "c4d700e708f2a338a737d0fb80297731", "html_url": "https://github.com/sorentwo", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sorentwo/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sorentwo/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sorentwo/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/c4d700e708f2a338a737d0fb80297731?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbf1a61ab02e3fa63fdd104e275614748.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sorentwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 270831, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sorentwo/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-25T13:18:32Z", "id": 21552876, "owner": "rails"}
