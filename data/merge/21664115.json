I'm working on rails when I have time and motivation to do it, which happens not really regularly and then I usually go through random issues and PRs (there is so many of them that I don't have any system for it). I just saw this one and wanted to act to hopefully get it merged.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions or if you want to add something, I'm sure we can sort it out. One thing that I see is missing is CHANGELOG entry for your fix, there is only one for `add_to_target` changes.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d391bd3543c151007f9d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11525#issuecomment-21664115"}
