{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8060", "repo": "rails", "body": "Gotcha.\r\n\r\nOne thing is the AR adapter, and a different one is the gem with the database driver used by the adapter. The AR adapter uses the low-level driver to provide the AR interface.\r\n\r\nActive Record tries to load the adapter, which in turn is going to load the corresponding gem. So `LoadError` may be caused by a missing _foo_adater.rb_, or by a missing gem.\r\n\r\nI would be either more vague in the error message (as it was before), or more exact, but the error message in the patch seems to be neither because the user may interpret the problem lies in the name of the adapter when a missing gem is the culprit.\r\n\r\nThe table in the message could be more informative if we provide all the information:\r\n\r\n    SQLite\r\n      adapter: sqlite3, gem: sqlite3\r\n\r\n    PostgreSQL\r\n      adapter: postgresql, gem: pg\r\n\r\n    MySQL\r\n      adapter: mysql2, gem: mysql2\r\n\r\n(with a different list for JRuby probably).\r\n\r\nOr maybe be more smart, because if the configured adapter is correct then we could just let the `LoadError` from the missing driver go up.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f644bd3543c15100ade1"}, "issue_id": 8060, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9879112", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8060#issuecomment-9879112", "updated_at": "2012-10-29T18:06:07Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-29T18:05:52Z", "id": 9879112, "owner": "rails"}
