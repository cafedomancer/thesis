It appears that `#empty?` is not properly loading the relation, resulting in additional queries for presence. That test probably passed because `#present?` calls `!blank?` which called `to_a` and explicitly loaded records. This makes `#test_presence` smell like a bad test to me.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dddcbd3543c151008b67"}, "issue_id": 10539, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/19123668", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10539#issuecomment-19123668", "updated_at": "2013-06-07T18:14:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis", "login": "davidcelis", "gravatar_id": "9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidcelis", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3e1a626a9e0c39eb548886c253bf9644.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 36873, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-06-07T18:12:47Z", "id": 19123668, "owner": "rails"}
