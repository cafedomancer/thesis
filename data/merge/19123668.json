It appears that `#empty?` is not properly loading the relation, resulting in additional queries for presence. That test probably passed because `#present?` calls `!blank?` which called `to_a` and explicitly loaded records. This makes `#test_presence` smell like a bad test to me.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dddcbd3543c151008b67"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10539#issuecomment-19123668"}
