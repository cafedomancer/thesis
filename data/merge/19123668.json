{"body": "I've fixed the actual build errors, it seems, but there's a failure proving a bit difficult to debug in `RelationsTest#test_presence`. It appears that `#empty?` is not properly loading the relation, resulting in additional queries for presence. That test probably passed because `#present?` calls `!blank?` which called `to_a` and explicitly loaded records.
