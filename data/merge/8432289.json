{"body": "@bcardarella thanks for the info, and @danmcclain thanks for the work... i'm good with any of those options. If we need integration in another library/gem, we'll likely need those accepted before this gets merged in. Having support for PG arrays in Rails shouldn't rely on any other libraries besides ActiveRecord and the 'pg' gem (or jdbc-postgres for jruby). If adding a library after the fact speeds things up, that would be fine, but it would be nice to get this functionality without having to add another gem to my Gemfile on new projects.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8432289", "created_at": "2012-09-10T18:09:32Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7547#issuecomment-8432289", "updated_at": "2012-09-10T18:09:32Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7547, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/schneems", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ef42a6eab211ddd71ac423a80b42d15.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/received_events", "gravatar_id": "db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "schneems", "type": "User", "id": 59744, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ddf91bd354364b900b007"}, "id": 8432289, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7547"}
