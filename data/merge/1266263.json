In engine with dummy app, there are some rake tasks that should work with integration wit dummy path (like db tasks). This was added to allow people develop engines similarly to applications, so you can do something like that: \r\n\r\n```shell\r\nrails g scaffold post title:string body:text\r\nrake db:migrate # runs migrations for dummy app + engine, so you can test it properly\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this was not tested properly, but there should be such tests, at least for simplest cases (like rake db:migrate).\r\n\r\nAlso, namespaced generators does not work because of a hack that I used to not rewrite the entire generators system ;)\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/generators/named_base.rb#L65", "_id": {"$oid": "52401112bd354364b901e058"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1356#issuecomment-1266263"}
