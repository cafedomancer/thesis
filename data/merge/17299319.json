If there's a user, the constraint will match and then the routes inside the `authenticated` block will become available and recognizable, meaning that the `root` route will match for the authenticated user. When there's no user, anything inside the block is considered, and the `root` route would match the other definition. But both point to `root` and use `root_path`.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b900469d"}, "issue_id": 9704, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17299319", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-17299319", "updated_at": "2013-05-01T18:58:36Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-01T18:58:36Z", "id": 17299319, "owner": "rails"}
