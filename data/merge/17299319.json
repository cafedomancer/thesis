If there's a user, the constraint will match and then the routes inside the `authenticated` block will become available and recognizable, meaning that the `root` route will match for the authenticated user. When there's no user, anything inside the block is considered, and the `root` route would match the other definition. But both point to `root` and use `root_path`.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b900469d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-17299319"}
