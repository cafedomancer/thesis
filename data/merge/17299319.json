{"body": "@trevorturk in case of Devise, `authenticated` generates a route constraint checking whether or not there's a user signed in. If there's a user, the constraint will match and then the routes inside the `authenticated` block will become available and recognizable, meaning that the `root` route will match for the authenticated user. When there's no user, anything inside the block is considered, and the `root` route would match the other definition.
