In which case `first` or `last` wouldn't matter. However that doesn't always work. Just because an IP is in the `trusted_proxies` range doesn't mean it's actually a proxy. And this line can wind up stripping out the client's IP as well.\r\n\r\nThere's another issues that covers this problem: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/1010.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this would be a better solution.\r\n\r\nreturn forwarded_ips.first || @env[\"REMOTE_ADDR\"]", "_id": {"$oid": "52384314bd3543c151010ba0"}, "issue_id": 2490, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1856406", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2490#issuecomment-1856406", "updated_at": "2011-08-19T20:40:49Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamcrown/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamcrown/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamcrown/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamcrown/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamcrown", "login": "adamcrown", "gravatar_id": "8e376bdb110a47cc06658bf84d46d515", "html_url": "https://github.com/adamcrown", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamcrown/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamcrown/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamcrown/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/8e376bdb110a47cc06658bf84d46d515?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa0d85a3e1a35b95531490bbd86e87c34.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamcrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 277306, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adamcrown/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-08-19T20:40:49Z", "id": 1856406, "owner": "rails"}
