{"body": "FWICS, the bug that this fixes does not actually exist on the 3.x branches. The bug that was fixed by https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6477 does though, so that's the fix that needs to be backported.\n\nThe test coverage from here would be helpful in preventing further regressions of psql reconnection functionality regardless of the cause, and so might be useful to backport. Please note, however, that I badly mangled the first of those tests, and subsequently mangled my initial attempt at fixing it, which I rushed through due to my embarrassment at the initial test mangling. Therefore, also see https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7292 and https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7294.\n\nI can probably be available to work this back-porting, but it could take me a week or 3 to squeeze it into my schedule.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7684067", "created_at": "2012-08-13T06:09:32Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6654#issuecomment-7684067", "updated_at": "2012-08-13T06:09:32Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6654, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevecj/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevecj/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevecj/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevecj", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevecj/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/stevecj", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevecj/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4f6079564f02b87e4c0989585439eb39?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F116eb226cf0b16d4f0bb6c09d94f74f5.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevecj/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevecj/received_events", "gravatar_id": "4f6079564f02b87e4c0989585439eb39", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevecj/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "stevecj", "type": "User", "id": 388671, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevecj/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e346ebd354364b900e686"}, "id": 7684067, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6654"}
