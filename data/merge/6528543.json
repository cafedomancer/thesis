Now you can't use `time` datatypes in a production PG database, and use sqlite3 in test.  The reason is because if you create a time column, it will just be dumped to schema.rb as a datetime.\n\nI'm not 100% sure what we should do about the situation.  If this example wasn't using string substitution, we could detect the column type as `time` and apply the appropriate [sqlite3 function](http://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html) in order to ensure the query returns the right results.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380aabbd3543c15100cf3d"}, "issue_id": 6344, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6528543", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6344#issuecomment-6528543", "updated_at": "2012-06-23T21:36:57Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "login": "tenderlove", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-23T21:36:57Z", "id": 6528543, "owner": "rails"}
