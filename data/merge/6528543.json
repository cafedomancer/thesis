Now you can't use `time` datatypes in a production PG database, and use sqlite3 in test.  The reason is because if you create a time column, it will just be dumped to schema.rb as a datetime.\n\nI'm not 100% sure what we should do about the situation.  If this example wasn't using string substitution, we could detect the column type as `time` and apply the appropriate [sqlite3 function](http://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html) in order to ensure the query returns the right results.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380aabbd3543c15100cf3d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6344#issuecomment-6528543"}
