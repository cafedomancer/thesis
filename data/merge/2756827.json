[I've just started experimenting with this technique](https://github.com/emmanuel/dm-core/blob/feature/more_domain_objects/lib/dm-core/model/property_accessor_module.rb). \r\n\r\nIt's a bit of a brain-twist at first: you define Module instance methods which in turn dynamically define instance methods in the including class, but it works great. Most importantly, it lets you collect the dynamic method definition logic in one place and name it with *intention-revealing selectors* :D.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting: if you define `#inspect` on the module, you'll get meaningful output from `FooModel.ancestors` (more meaningful than `#<Module 0x00000>`).", "_id": {"$oid": "523f5c6ebd354364b9017434"}, "issue_id": 3636, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2756827", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3636#issuecomment-2756827", "updated_at": "2011-11-16T07:59:53Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel", "login": "emmanuel", "gravatar_id": "83611ed7f7ed587603fbdffc691ea989", "html_url": "https://github.com/emmanuel", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/83611ed7f7ed587603fbdffc691ea989?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F82674fc29bc0d9895cee346548c2cb5c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 7657, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-16T07:59:53Z", "id": 2756827, "owner": "rails"}
