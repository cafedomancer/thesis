My thinking was to avoid changing the semantics of DatabaseTasks#class_for_adapter, in case we might want to use it to determine whether an adapter is currently supported (i.e. explicitly detect nil as a return value). But since it's private, maybe that's not a big deal. If we all think it's better to raise directly out of class_for_adapter, I'll submit a changed request.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ecddbd3543c151009d54"}, "issue_id": 9119, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12903233", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9119#issuecomment-12903233", "updated_at": "2013-01-30T18:03:47Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dazuma", "login": "dazuma", "gravatar_id": "e06aa8f63d2a1753a2b352bc1cabbde2", "html_url": "https://github.com/dazuma", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e06aa8f63d2a1753a2b352bc1cabbde2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ffed537780f3f29cc5d5f313bbda423c4.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 8911, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dazuma/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-30T18:03:47Z", "id": 12903233, "owner": "rails"}
