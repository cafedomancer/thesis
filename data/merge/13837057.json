The CHANGELOG was incorrect so I rewrote my entry. And you're right that ```limit``` isn't related to this commit.\r\n\r\nAlso I see what you're saying about ```having``` so I'm reverting to the old behavior. I think this is fine because, as you said, ruby will throw an error if you don't have a first argument.
