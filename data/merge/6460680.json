{"body": "I don't think I agree with the assertion that this change is exactly the opposite of hard-code. There isn't currently a hard-coded assumption that :confirm generates a data-confirm attribute, is there? The UJS drivers depend on that behavior, to be sure, but that's different than the contract between the link_to helper and its users. Forcing the latter to insert a :data hash strongly implies that the link_to implementation *is* going to render a data-confirm attribute.\n\nIf we're dead set against a top-level :confirm abstract option (which I'm not), using a :ujs hash instead of a :data hash might be a better way to educate users that those options are intended for a UJS driver.\n\nI realize this is bikeshedding to an extent, so I won't waste your time with an extended commentary; I just wanted to register my objection to an API change that I don't think takes us in the right direction.
