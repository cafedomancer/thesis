At the end of the day, AP and AV are still closely tight together and 95% of the project or maybe even more will be always using rails with AV.\r\n\r\nHowever, almost all of the tests concerning ActionView were moved away from AP to AV, and you can find them as integration ones in `actionview/test/actionpack` (https://github.com/strzalek/rails/tree/extract_renderers/actionview/test/actionpack). Notice that AV has also dev dep on AP as it needs stuff from there.\r\n\r\nBesides that, in `railties` you can find `basic_rendering_test.rb` (https://github.com/strzalek/rails/blob/extract_renderers/railties/test/application/basic_rendering_test.rb) which is end-to-end test, checking if rails application without AV works as supposed. (it generates full rails app, makes few changes to files and setup, runs it and checks what was rendered).\r\n\r\nThat's how it is now. I think that AV should stay as dev dep on AP for now. We have quite good coverage to be sure if stuff with/without AV works properly. Maybe it'll change some time in the future, during the process of refactoring tests, because I must admit, in some places you can find huge mess in there.\r\n\r\nHope that explains everything, @egilburg. Let me know if you still have any questions.", "_id": {"$oid": "523c79f6bd354364b90010a4"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11396#issuecomment-22517398"}
