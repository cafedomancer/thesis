{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5582", "repo": "rails", "body": "The way we look at predicates in the project is: write natural code, and document a generic contract in any case. Natural code for us does not include double negations or ternaries or that kind of *forcing* a singleton. If the natural code returns a singleton, fine. If it does not, fine. You cannot rely on a singleton **in any case** if the documentation does not guarantee one, so it just does not matter to your code, **client code is not going to be able to rely on it in any case**.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to prove a point and you qualified that policy as \"stupid\"... what can I say man. I don't care. Your commit fit in this guideline, as I explained in the rationale, so it went it.\r\n\r\nThat said, I had unsubscribed from all the different discussions about this thing, and didn't from this one. I am going to do that now.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5238159dbd3543c15100dd23"}, "issue_id": 5582, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5234951", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5582#issuecomment-5234951", "updated_at": "2012-04-19T23:29:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-19T23:29:51Z", "id": 5234951, "owner": "rails"}
