Natural code for us does not include double negations or ternaries or that kind of *forcing* a singleton. If the natural code returns a singleton, fine. If it does not, fine. You cannot rely on a singleton **in any case** if the documentation does not guarantee one, so it just does not matter to your code, **client code is not going to be able to rely on it in any case**.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to prove a point and you qualified that policy as \"stupid\"... what can I say man. I don't care. Your commit fit in this guideline, as I explained in the rationale, so it went it.\r\n\r\nThat said, I had unsubscribed from all the different discussions about this thing, and didn't from this one. I am going to do that now.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5238159dbd3543c15100dd23"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5582#issuecomment-5234951"}
