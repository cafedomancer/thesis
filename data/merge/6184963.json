{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6665", "repo": "rails", "body": "I am still uneasy about some of these changes. The fact we are white-listing many rake tasks makes my spider-sense go crazy. Here is what I propose:\n\n1) Have a method like `ActiveRecord::Migrator.check_pending_migrations!` (or in `ActiveRecord::Base`);\n2) We could add this method by default in test/test_helper.rb. This way we don't need to whitelist anything, removing it is as easy as removing one line. RSpec can do the same;\n3) Then, all we need is a configuration to add the middleware, which will be set only in development and does not even need to belong to `ActiveRecord::Base`, it will solely be part of `AR::Railtie`.\n\nThanks a lot for your work!", "_id": {"$oid": "523e33eebd354364b900e609"}, "issue_id": 6665, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6184963", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6665#issuecomment-6184963", "updated_at": "2012-06-07T19:13:33Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-07T19:13:33Z", "id": 6184963, "owner": "rails"}
