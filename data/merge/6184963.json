The fact we are white-listing many rake tasks makes my spider-sense go crazy. Here is what I propose:\n\n1) Have a method like `ActiveRecord::Migrator.check_pending_migrations!` (or in `ActiveRecord::Base`);\n2) We could add this method by default in test/test_helper.rb. This way we don't need to whitelist anything, removing it is as easy as removing one line. RSpec can do the same;\n3) Then, all we need is a configuration to add the middleware, which will be set only in development and does not even need to belong to `ActiveRecord::Base`, it will solely be part of `AR::Railtie`.\n\nThanks a lot for your work!", "_id": {"$oid": "523e33eebd354364b900e609"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6665#issuecomment-6184963"}
