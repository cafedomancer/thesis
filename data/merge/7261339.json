{"body": "Thanks @kennyj . Can I propose a different solution though? I see that you are allowing `-` as a character just so it can be picked up in another regular expression later. A different solution would be, inside of retrieve_variable, we check both regexps:\n\n```ruby\n    variable = if as = @options[:as]\n      unless as.to_s =~ /\\A[a-z_]\\w*\\z/\n        raise ...\n      end\n      as.to_sym\n    else\n      base = File.dirname(path)\n      if base =~ /\\A_?([a-z]\\w*)(\\.\\w+)*\\z/\n        $1.to_sym\n      else\n        raise ...\n      end\n    end\n```\n\nThe main idea is this, but I think it could be properly refactored.
