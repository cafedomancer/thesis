Using `false` also follows the pattern established by `autosave`, where omitting the option / setting it to `nil` gives the default behavior (for `autosave`, only autosaving on new records) while `false` completely disables the behavior.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1ea1bd354364b9004dcb"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9522#issuecomment-14627735"}
