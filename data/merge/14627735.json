Using `false` also follows the pattern established by `autosave`, where omitting the option / setting it to `nil` gives the default behavior (for `autosave`, only autosaving on new records) while `false` completely disables the behavior.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1ea1bd354364b9004dcb"}, "issue_id": 9522, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14627735", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9522#issuecomment-14627735", "updated_at": "2013-03-08T16:08:40Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr", "login": "al2o3cr", "gravatar_id": "6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243", "html_url": "https://github.com/al2o3cr", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb20bb95ab626d93fd976af958fbc61ba.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1191, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-08T16:08:40Z", "id": 14627735, "owner": "rails"}
