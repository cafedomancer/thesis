This appears to be a complete replacement that doesn't use or touch rake at all.\r\n\r\nSince this is a replacement for existing working (if slow) code I would like to see evidence of why it is pointless to try to make `rake` or the rails test running tasks faster.\r\n\r\nCould it be something I can improve in rake?", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5a22bd354364b900607b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9080#issuecomment-12743774"}
