This appears to be a complete replacement that doesn't use or touch rake at all.\r\n\r\nSince this is a replacement for existing working (if slow) code I would like to see evidence of why it is pointless to try to make `rake` or the rails test running tasks faster.\r\n\r\nCould it be something I can improve in rake?", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5a22bd354364b900607b"}, "issue_id": 9080, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12743774", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9080#issuecomment-12743774", "updated_at": "2013-01-26T22:38:57Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drbrain/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drbrain/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drbrain/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drbrain/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drbrain", "login": "drbrain", "gravatar_id": "58479f76374a3ba3c69b9804163f39f4", "html_url": "https://github.com/drbrain", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drbrain/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drbrain/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drbrain/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/58479f76374a3ba3c69b9804163f39f4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa62dd1eb9b15f8d11a8bf167591c2f17.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drbrain/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9831, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drbrain/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-26T22:38:57Z", "id": 12743774, "owner": "rails"}
