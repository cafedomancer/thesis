{"body": "@amatsuda I have edited your code following the suggestion by @josevalim so WhereChain is now a class with a builder, rather than a mixin. I have also added documentation and edited the CHANGELOG. It's all in this new pull request: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8365\r\n\r\n@josevalim I think that, after my commit, it becomes clearer how to chain those three new methods. If you agree, I would like to make it even clearer by explicitly raising an `ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid` if one of those methods is used without being preceded by `where`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    Post.not(name: 'Jose')\r\n\r\nRight now, the previous line would just raise a generic error saying that the method `not` is not defined on Post. The same for `Post.like(conditions)` and `Post.not_like(conditions)`.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'd like to draw your attention to this required change in the test: https://github.com/claudiob/rails/commit/be71e1a7a1048f1dfa68bf73a487228f251b7be5#L2L302. \r\nIn other words, calling `Post.where(nil)` now is equivalent to `Post.where`, which is not a no-op anymore, but instead creates an instance of `WhereChain` to be chained with `not`, `like`, or `not_like`. \r\nIs this the behavior you were looking for? Or would you rather still have `Post.where(nil)` equivalent to `Post.where(\"\")`?\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10837909", "created_at": "2012-11-29T07:37:02Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8332#issuecomment-10837909", "updated_at": "2012-11-29T07:38:30Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8332, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/claudiob", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/4dea5cf83d2d6c1228750b76e579b38d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F11ed516444b2593eaba7f2c2bb63483e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/received_events", "gravatar_id": "4dea5cf83d2d6c1228750b76e579b38d", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "claudiob", "type": "User", "id": 10076, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523d97adbd354364b90082fe"}, "id": 10837909, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8332"}
