And I wrote some tests to check different order usage\r\n\r\nAnd btw I think that we shouldn't filter values from X_FORWARDED_FOR and give to user unexpected IP of unknown proxy server. We should give him only first or last ip from list as we decided here. I changed code in remote_ip.rb and fix tests for it.
