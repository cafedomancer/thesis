{"body": "Hi Jose,\r\n\r\nDo you mean allowing an extra parameter in the block passed to fields_for?\r\n\r\nIn fact, my first try was following this approach, checking if the passed block has more than one parameter, in which case I setted the current child index value in the second param.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have chosen the fields_for_with_index option based on the existent discussion in the open ticket, and also thinking in the Enumerable methods each and each_with_index.. \r\nHowever, allowing a second parameter in the block used to invoke fields_for seems to be a feasible option as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1215314", "created_at": "2011-05-21T19:38:57Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1189#issuecomment-1215314", "updated_at": "2011-05-21T19:38:57Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 1189, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jmbejar/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jmbejar/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jmbejar/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jmbejar", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jmbejar/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jmbejar", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jmbejar/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/10349623c33510dcf7a6c0805d948465?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe650703a8c479f9bf1804f82a7b81bca.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jmbejar/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jmbejar/received_events", "gravatar_id": "10349623c33510dcf7a6c0805d948465", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jmbejar/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jmbejar", "type": "User", "id": 487140, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jmbejar/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52385becbd3543c151011ea6"}, "id": 1215314, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1189"}
