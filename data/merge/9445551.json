{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7951", "repo": "rails", "body": "Are you sure this behavior is desired? `rake db:schema:load` loads the db schema into the development database without the need to specify `RAILS_ENV=development` on the command line. `rake db:structure:load` is supposed to behave alike.\r\n\r\nFurthermore `rake db:structure:load` *did* access the development database in version 3.2.6. That changed somewhere on the road between 3.2.6 and 3.2.8. Can you confirm that this change in behavior is by design?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f760bd3543c15100b03e"}, "issue_id": 7951, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9445551", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7951#issuecomment-9445551", "updated_at": "2012-10-15T13:54:56Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Grandrath/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Grandrath/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Grandrath/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Grandrath/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Grandrath", "login": "Grandrath", "gravatar_id": "3192f0f3cf1c1039ac3677592882006a", "html_url": "https://github.com/Grandrath", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Grandrath/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Grandrath/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Grandrath/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3192f0f3cf1c1039ac3677592882006a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa1fd29f42d5730726c9698c908905d3a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Grandrath/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 399903, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Grandrath/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-15T13:54:56Z", "id": 9445551, "owner": "rails"}
