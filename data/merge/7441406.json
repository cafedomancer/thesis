Why not just fix the broken behaviour?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Aug 2, 2012 at 9:03 AM, Wojciech Wn\u0119trzak <\r\nreply@reply.github.com\r\n> wrote:\r\n\r\n> I'm voting for removing `becomes` from Rails ;-) - I can prepare patch for\r\n> that.\r\n> After merging this pull request, there will be problem described here:\r\n> https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3023#issuecomment-7395821\r\n>\r\n> @rafaelfranca @jonleighton @tenderlove any thoughts on that?\r\n>\r\n> ---\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3023#issuecomment-7439876\r\n>", "_id": {"$oid": "523f90c1bd354364b9018dae"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3023#issuecomment-7441406"}
