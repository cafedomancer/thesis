{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3023", "repo": "rails", "body": "*sigh* Will there be any extraction of this feature into a gem so that\r\nthose that have and do use it can still get on with things?\r\n\r\nYanking it without providing some sort of alternative or documentation on\r\nthe correct way of handling STI with a single controller & views seems\r\nabout as insensitive as the original change that this ticket was created to\r\noppose.\r\n\r\nSorry to be so negative but it seems like you're just wanting to remove it\r\nbecause \"I never used that feature\" and because it has some flawed use\r\ncases. Why not just fix the broken behaviour?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Aug 2, 2012 at 9:03 AM, Wojciech Wn\u0119trzak <\r\nreply@reply.github.com\r\n> wrote:\r\n\r\n> I'm voting for removing `becomes` from Rails ;-) - I can prepare patch for\r\n> that.\r\n> After merging this pull request, there will be problem described here:\r\n> https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3023#issuecomment-7395821\r\n>\r\n> @rafaelfranca @jonleighton @tenderlove any thoughts on that?\r\n>\r\n> ---\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3023#issuecomment-7439876\r\n>", "_id": {"$oid": "523f90c1bd354364b9018dae"}, "issue_id": 3023, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7441406", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3023#issuecomment-7441406", "updated_at": "2012-08-01T22:00:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brendon/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brendon/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brendon/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brendon/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brendon", "login": "brendon", "gravatar_id": "5cc165c5b9f18bfb64faddb021c82172", "html_url": "https://github.com/brendon", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brendon/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brendon/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brendon/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5cc165c5b9f18bfb64faddb021c82172?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F40ab5635391fe4ae6b3211682dd4178c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brendon/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 81871, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brendon/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-01T22:00:12Z", "id": 7441406, "owner": "rails"}
