Currently I can't handle it, as it doesn't even get to my controller because some non-related code raises an exception.\r\n\r\nThe fix I propose resolves a newly (since 3.2.2) introduced ArgumentError when looking up static resources. I don't think this rack module should raise an exception no matter what parameters it gets.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we are using slugs for SEO purposes. For many of those, the characters after the ID are non-essential for looking up the article or whatever. The issue with encoded characters: if a byte gets cut off (happens way to easy), the user will get a 500 error. If that happens with a slug only consisting of ASCII characters, it isn't an issue, we can just redirect you to the correct URL. \r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523819aabd3543c15100e1dd"}, "issue_id": 5337, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4466366", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5337#issuecomment-4466366", "updated_at": "2012-03-13T02:25:35Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mreinsch/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mreinsch/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mreinsch/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mreinsch/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mreinsch", "login": "mreinsch", "gravatar_id": "2f0438cf56a9d890b487440d3a85043e", "html_url": "https://github.com/mreinsch", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mreinsch/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mreinsch/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mreinsch/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2f0438cf56a9d890b487440d3a85043e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe2655055c20c349c3c67aab7156eb6df.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mreinsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 33982, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mreinsch/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-13T02:25:35Z", "id": 4466366, "owner": "rails"}
