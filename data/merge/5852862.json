{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6315", "repo": "rails", "body": "@yfeldblum, in my opinion, methods that format numbers and numberish strings make more sense on Numeric than on String.  Having them sit in a separate module works, but feels about as clean as having them be class methods, to me.  If the community as a whole feels that I should move these class methods to a separate, ActiveSupport-specific module, I can do that.\n\nIs there anything more I can do to move this forward?  Are we waiting on @fxn 's input on whether the methods should be to_s or to_formatted_s?\n\nLet me know if there's any way I can help.
