In an ideal world I agree that the client ought to be fixing it, but that doesn't sound practical.  IE's double-download behaviour with protocol-relative stylesheets is a good example: it would be great if Microsoft would fix it, but in the meantime Rails specifies absolute urls on css.", "_id": {"$oid": "523833d0bd3543c15100fa85"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3660#issuecomment-2776498"}
