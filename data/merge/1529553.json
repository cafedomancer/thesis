I had monkey patched table_exists? so that I could use Postgresql schemas and I was running into problems when I used set_table_name on a model with a schema (i.e. set_table_name 'meta.accounts').  I applied your patch and it fixed my issues with table_exists?\r\n\r\nWould love to see this added into Rails as I have an app that makes heavy use of Postgresql schemas, a feature which is mostly unusable with an unhacked Rails install.
