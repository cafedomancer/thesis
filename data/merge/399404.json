{"body": "Hey Mikel! Piotr was one RSoC students and these are a few fixes to his work. Usually I'm merging his work, but right now I cannot that (on vacation withOut computer) and oddly his commits do not appear on the fork queue.\r\n\r\nAll the first three commits are correct, except the last one which as you noted need some test, but he doesn't need to open a ticket on LH. Could you please merge in his first three commits? And the other one when a test is added?
