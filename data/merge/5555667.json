{"body": "This pull request touches too many things.\r\n\r\n* :+1: to removing the docs for those `class_inheritable_*` methods.\r\n* The documentation of `truncate` has actually to say that _both_ strings and regexps are valid arguments. It has to say that in English, not implicitly via an example. Examples then could depict each use case.\r\n* The docs for the time extensions to `Numeric` are good, but instead of `Time.now` the equivalence is with `Time.current` (and the API is wrong here also if I am not mistaken).\r\n* The comment about `Range#include?` means that _albeit_ `===` is an alias of the original method, you don't get these extensions on `===` (because aliasing is not transitive). So I think the warning should be left as is.\r\n\r\nIf you revise those it may be good to go.
