{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5861", "repo": "rails", "body": "For the record, MultiJson 1.3 is intended to be completely backwards compatible with all the previous 1.x releases, following [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). It throws deprecation warnings about APIs that will be removed come version 2, but it should not break any of those APIs.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, there's no good reason to restrict people to < 1.3. If they want to use MultiJson 1.3 with Rails 3.2, they'll get warnings, which they can either disable or ignore. The other option is for them to stick with an earlier version of MultiJson, which should work just fine, but it seems like this decision should be up to the user instead of being enforced by Active Support.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381206bd3543c15100d8e0"}, "issue_id": 5861, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5212898", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5861#issuecomment-5212898", "updated_at": "2012-04-19T01:23:02Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sferik/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sferik/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sferik/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sferik/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sferik", "login": "sferik", "gravatar_id": "1f74b13f1e5c6c69cb5d7fbaabb1e2cb", "html_url": "https://github.com/sferik", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sferik/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sferik/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sferik/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/1f74b13f1e5c6c69cb5d7fbaabb1e2cb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9efb1a59d7b58e69996cf0e32cb71098.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sferik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 10308, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sferik/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-19T01:19:54Z", "id": 5212898, "owner": "rails"}
