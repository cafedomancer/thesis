Basically the Symbol#to_proc in 1.9 is just more optimized (a symbol's proc is cached, and the cost of calling to_proc over a block can be cheaper). It's something I wouldn't worry about in your everyday Rails code, but for core Rails code which is accessed so often I can understand why this sort of sugar would want to be avoided.", "_id": {"$oid": "523847a1bd3543c1510110b1"}, "issue_id": 2157, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1611106", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2157#issuecomment-1611106", "updated_at": "2011-07-19T22:03:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire", "login": "mcmire", "gravatar_id": "e9e852b18079792bc5f4ec52b8e37c53", "html_url": "https://github.com/mcmire", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e9e852b18079792bc5f4ec52b8e37c53?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0d46839f6371fb84f6b6c682f5fc2c77.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 7371, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-07-19T22:03:42Z", "id": 1611106, "owner": "rails"}
