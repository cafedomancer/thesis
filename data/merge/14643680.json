I think it's fine that we do `Rake::Task['db:test:prepare']` for now.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that all the tasks in https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/railties/databases.rake has to be converted into a new class, with tests, so that it can be called by a new subscriber and rake task without having to duplicate the code.\r\n\r\nAll it's left now is that @rubys is seeing some failing test case after using `rails test`.
