I think it's fine that we do `Rake::Task['db:test:prepare']` for now.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that all the tasks in https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/railties/databases.rake has to be converted into a new class, with tests, so that it can be called by a new subscriber and rake task without having to duplicate the code.\r\n\r\nAll it's left now is that @rubys is seeing some failing test case after using `rails test`. I'm looking into that right now.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5a22bd354364b9006088"}, "issue_id": 9080, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14643680", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9080#issuecomment-14643680", "updated_at": "2013-03-08T20:27:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu", "login": "sikachu", "gravatar_id": "f1c4a3bb1606cc4a61711e61e2fe6146", "html_url": "https://github.com/sikachu", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f1c4a3bb1606cc4a61711e61e2fe6146?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a4526b1ec301744aba9526d78fcb2a6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4912, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-08T20:27:04Z", "id": 14643680, "owner": "rails"}
