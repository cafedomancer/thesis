{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7324", "repo": "rails", "body": "@schneems Thanks I'll do that. And thanks for offering! Had a busy last week, so sorry for the late answer:\r\n\r\nPostgres has a type point which is a tuple of two floats. I want to add native support to ActiveRecord for this type.\r\n\r\nWhen ActiveRecord queries Postgres about the type of such a point column it doesn't return \"point\" but rather \"this is a composite type made up of two floats\" (OIDs of data types).\r\n\r\nI looked through the then current AR code to figure out how to hook into only that and then convert PG point <--> Ruby Array but for some reason I couldn't get it to work.\r\n\r\nI've seen that my pull request doesn't merge cleanly any more, so maybe something has changed. I'll try again to make this work (since in principle it should be easy IMO) and will come back with some concrete question once I've hit a roadblock.", "_id": {"$oid": "523df6ecbd354364b900bdd8"}, "issue_id": 7324, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12039410", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7324#issuecomment-12039410", "updated_at": "2013-01-09T10:54:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch", "login": "MSch", "gravatar_id": "64afebe5db598b0b043f35560bf940df", "html_url": "https://github.com/MSch", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/64afebe5db598b0b043f35560bf940df?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc73071b4520a9a82990741a84a2144eb.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 7475, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MSch/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-09T10:54:20Z", "id": 12039410, "owner": "rails"}
