Right?\r\n\r\nEven so, I could test `controller_name` and `action_name`. (Not bad, but not quite what I want.)\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to check the context of what form I'm inside as well. In particular, I'd like to check if a custom form builder is being used. How could I do this?\r\n\r\nAfter looking at `self` inside `utf8_enforcer_tag`, I don't see a way to do it. If a new design is considered, I would suggest the following: since `utf8_enforcer_tag` is applied at the form level, it makes sense to allow it to be overridden in a way that is form-specific.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385e70bd3543c15101207c"}, "issue_id": 549, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16483122", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/549#issuecomment-16483122", "updated_at": "2013-04-17T02:08:30Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djwonk/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djwonk/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djwonk/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djwonk/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/djwonk", "login": "djwonk", "gravatar_id": "84a4143803eafa1966191c604864a7b5", "html_url": "https://github.com/djwonk", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djwonk/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djwonk/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djwonk/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/84a4143803eafa1966191c604864a7b5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F512fc3c5227f637e41437c999a2d3169.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djwonk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3094, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/djwonk/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-04-17T02:08:16Z", "id": 16483122, "owner": "rails"}
