In particular, I'd like to check if a custom form builder is being used. How could I do this?\r\n\r\nAfter looking at `self` inside `utf8_enforcer_tag`, I don't see a way to do it. If a new design is considered, I would suggest the following: since `utf8_enforcer_tag` is applied at the form level, it makes sense to allow it to be overridden in a way that is form-specific.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385e70bd3543c15101207c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/549#issuecomment-16483122"}
