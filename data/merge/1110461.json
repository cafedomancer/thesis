{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/396", "repo": "rails", "body": "Context for this ticket. \r\n\r\nThe ticket deals with errors relating to multiparamter attributes. \r\n\r\n1. ````time_select```` allows for an option ````:ignore_date => true````. This option was added [here](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/503-add-deny_hidden-option-to-date-helpers-so-rails-doesn-t-render-them). It was added for design reasons where the developer wanted to style date_select and time_select differently and not have one overwrite the other.\r\n\r\n2.  ````:ignore_date => true```` usage is not documented clearly enough. Leading to bugs as reported [here](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/4346-time_select-not-interpreting-the-multi-parameter-correctly). \r\n\r\n3. If you use ````:ignore_date => true```` with ````time_select```` and dont have a ````date_select```` on the same attribute, funny things will [happen](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/dfc64e24151c7880). Time attributes would shift to date and silently work (if the time attributes can be turned into a date) or throw up if the time attributes do not form into a valid date.\r\n\r\n4. @asanghi with the massive input from (@andreacampi) have addressed various issues with Multiparameter attribute handling. Some of those issues include \r\n\r\n    * Handling Date, Time distinctly from other multiparameter classes separately.\r\n    * Handling DOS type attack by providing very high parameter indexes.\r\n    * Handling empty parameters for Date and Time. \r\n    * Handling nil parameters for Date and Time.\r\n    * Raising appropriate exceptions \r\n    * Refactoring Multiparameter attribute handling.\r\n    * Adding many more tests.\r\n\r\nI believe this fix should be applied to 3.0.x and possibly even to 2.3.x branch. \r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523860c4bd3543c1510122b5"}, "issue_id": 396, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1110461", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/396#issuecomment-1110461", "updated_at": "2011-05-06T09:52:45Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi", "login": "asanghi", "gravatar_id": "f4ba063457702c78a7fce6a3529aedb0", "html_url": "https://github.com/asanghi", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f4ba063457702c78a7fce6a3529aedb0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F06997f04a7db92466a2baa6ebc8b872d.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 762, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-06T09:52:45Z", "id": 1110461, "owner": "rails"}
