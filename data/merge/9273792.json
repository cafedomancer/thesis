{"body": "@justinko I have an idea for a separate pull request that will address generating rake tasks for additional directories under test. So tests in `test/lib` and `test/presenters` and `test/serializers` and `test/decorators` would be run with:\r\n\r\n    rake test:lib\r\n    rake test:presenters\r\n    rake test:serializers\r\n    rake test:decorators\r\n\r\nBut that will be a separate pull request. :)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9273792", "created_at": "2012-10-09T18:41:06Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7878#issuecomment-9273792", "updated_at": "2012-10-09T18:41:06Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7878, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/blowmage", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cd8da976054ea4915eafc5d9dd096d38?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd5cfead94f5350c12c322b5b664544c1.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/received_events", "gravatar_id": "cd8da976054ea4915eafc5d9dd096d38", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "blowmage", "type": "User", "id": 730, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7febd3543c15100b196"}, "id": 9273792, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7878"}
