{"body": "I'm ok with the idea, I just think there's a possibility of breaking current applications that may be relying on the current `presence` validation not ignoring records marked for destruction (even if it's wrong or not).\n\nFor that, I think we need a changelog entry, and some docs in this file explaining why this presence validator exists and what makes it different from the Active Model one.
