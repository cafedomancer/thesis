Guide updates are also welcome.\n\nThanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "523e239bbd354364b900dc06"}, "issue_id": 6827, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6525339", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6827#issuecomment-6525339", "updated_at": "2012-06-23T14:31:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-23T14:31:37Z", "id": 6525339, "owner": "rails"}
