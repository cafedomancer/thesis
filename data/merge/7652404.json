Explicit definition here looks like common sense to me. \n\nfor example we have      config.filter_parameters += [:password] but we also could have it built in and ask developers to write      config.filter_parameters -= [:password] if they don't want to filter passwords. It is a bit 'monkey patching'. Please, let's leave it as is, I think it's a better option.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fd6dbd3543c15100bb29"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7302#issuecomment-7652404"}
