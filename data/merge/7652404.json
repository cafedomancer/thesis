Explicit definition here looks like common sense to me. \n\nfor example we have      config.filter_parameters += [:password] but we also could have it built in and ask developers to write      config.filter_parameters -= [:password] if they don't want to filter passwords. It is a bit 'monkey patching'. Please, let's leave it as is, I think it's a better option.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fd6dbd3543c15100bb29"}, "issue_id": 7302, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7652404", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7302#issuecomment-7652404", "updated_at": "2012-08-10T18:13:48Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov", "login": "homakov", "gravatar_id": "d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d", "html_url": "https://github.com/homakov", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc1464ded796adc7ac65355e3cc0df165.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 174693, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-10T18:13:48Z", "id": 7652404, "owner": "rails"}
