I think it's important though to think about what you consider a public branch. The problems start when other people depend on your work. I would consider a branch in your own fork, which is open for discussion to still be a private branch. If someone depends on it, they need a good reason and should be able to fix the situation when your branch changes. I consider PR-Branches to be exposed local branches that you can reason about and you should be able to change them upside down.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f152bd3543c15100a419"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8651#issuecomment-11765717"}
