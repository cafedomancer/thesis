{"body": "> never rewrite a public branch!\r\n\r\nThis is a good principle to follow. I think it's important though to think about what you consider a public branch. The problems start when other people depend on your work. I would consider a branch in your own fork, which is open for discussion to still be a private branch. If someone depends on it, they need a good reason and should be able to fix the situation when your branch changes. I consider PR-Branches to be exposed local branches that you can reason about and you should be able to change them upside down.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11765717", "created_at": "2012-12-30T15:46:47Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8651#issuecomment-11765717", "updated_at": "2012-12-30T15:46:47Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8651, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "senny", "type": "User", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f152bd3543c15100a419"}, "id": 11765717, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8651"}
