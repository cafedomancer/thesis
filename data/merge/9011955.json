{"body": "@steveklabnik, @rafaelfranca please have a look. I noticed that there are more internal variables. Should they be prefixed too? I don't think we should try to minimize naming conflicts as much as possible. The current list is:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n      INTERNAL_IVARS = [\r\n        :@__name__,\r\n        :@__io__,\r\n        :@_assertion_wrapped,\r\n        :@_assertions,\r\n        :@_result,\r\n        :@_routes,\r\n        :@controller,\r\n        :@_layouts,\r\n        :@locals,\r\n        :@method_name,\r\n        :@output_buffer,\r\n        :@_partials,\r\n        :@passed,\r\n        :@rendered,\r\n        :@request,\r\n        :@routes,\r\n        :@tagged_logger,\r\n        :@_templates,\r\n        :@options,\r\n        :@test_passed,\r\n        :@view,\r\n        :@view_context_class\r\n      ]\r\n```", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9011955", "created_at": "2012-09-30T09:00:34Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7797#issuecomment-9011955", "updated_at": "2012-09-30T09:00:34Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7797, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "senny", "type": "User", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f8d5bd3543c15100b35b"}, "id": 9011955, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7797"}
