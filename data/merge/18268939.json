You can override this and explicitly specify the primary key with the :primary_key option.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I assumed that you are using non-standard primary_key. But in the schema the table still has id in the primary key. That is why I was looking for first_name in the query.", "_id": {"$oid": "523cc2f3bd354364b90024a4"}, "issue_id": 10713, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18268939", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10713#issuecomment-18268939", "updated_at": "2013-05-22T10:05:09Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname", "login": "neerajdotname", "gravatar_id": "934f858e451cf9b771996b2940cd696b", "html_url": "https://github.com/neerajdotname", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/934f858e451cf9b771996b2940cd696b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F985e9a46e10005356bbaf194249f6856.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6399, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-22T10:05:09Z", "id": 18268939, "owner": "rails"}
