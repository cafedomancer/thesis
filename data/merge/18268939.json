{"body": "@senny Actually I'm still not sure what is the real bug. \r\n\r\nUsage of primary_key in the has_many is throwing me off.\r\n\r\nAs per the doc\r\n\r\n```\r\nBy convention, Rails assumes that the column used to hold the primary key of this model is id. You can override this and explicitly specify the primary key with the :primary_key option.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I assumed that you are using non-standard primary_key. But in the schema the table still has id in the primary key.
