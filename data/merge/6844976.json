{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6952", "repo": "rails", "body": "Valid points - and nahi confirmed that we would only add HKDF support to Ruby OpenSSL if OpenSSL itself supports it one day.\n\nRegarding PBKDF2, it's always  a bit tricky if an algorithm is used in slightly different ways than intended. \n\nI also do believe that the iteration count should be no concern. My main concern is rather how to handle the salts and how to get the determinism without weakening anything. \n\nA different question - will the master key be (re-)generated on startup (and only kept in memory) or is it read from (and stored to) an external location? If so, are there any measures to protect it there or is this left to the user?", "_id": {"$oid": "52380195bd3543c15100c177"}, "issue_id": 6952, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6844976", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6952#issuecomment-6844976", "updated_at": "2012-07-09T12:22:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emboss/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emboss/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emboss/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emboss/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emboss", "login": "emboss", "gravatar_id": "ada56d152c1abe0eba65a5ff62ed5387", "html_url": "https://github.com/emboss", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emboss/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emboss/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emboss/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ada56d152c1abe0eba65a5ff62ed5387?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3e0ccfd5b27c3147b2a9e7d02f862c91.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emboss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 486012, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emboss/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-09T12:22:04Z", "id": 6844976, "owner": "rails"}
