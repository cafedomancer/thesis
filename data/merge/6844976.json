My main concern is rather how to handle the salts and how to get the determinism without weakening anything. \n\nA different question - will the master key be (re-)generated on startup (and only kept in memory) or is it read from (and stored to) an external location? If so, are there any measures to protect it there or is this left to the user?", "_id": {"$oid": "52380195bd3543c15100c177"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6952#issuecomment-6844976"}
