{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8112", "repo": "rails", "body": "The Short version of the changes is:\r\n\r\n* Rename secret_key to secret_key_base, if you set secret_key then we verify cookies based on the raw secret (and fire a deprecation warning)\r\n* Use the key_generator code with static salts when deriving keys everywhere we derive keys\r\n* Provide config options for people to change those salts if they want to.\r\n* We don't advertise the salt configuration options as they don't seem necessary at all as the entropy comes from the base secret.  However the option's there for tinfoil hats \r\n* Introduce an EncryptedCookieJar which is encrypted (and signed) with keys derived from the base secret.\r\n* Default to using the encrypted cookie jar for the session data\r\n\r\nWhat we *don't* have yet, is a configuration option to transparently take an old session, and upgrade it to a new session. Broadly speaking I'm scared of automatic upgrades in crypto systems as I'm too dumb to know if there's an issue here.  It might be nice to have this as an option to encourage people to upgrade, but we'd need some guidance on the sanity, or otherwise, of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f5e3bd3543c15100ad16"}, "issue_id": 8112, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10089199", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8112#issuecomment-10089199", "updated_at": "2012-11-05T21:42:08Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-05T21:42:08Z", "id": 10089199, "owner": "rails"}
