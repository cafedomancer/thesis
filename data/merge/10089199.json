However the option's there for tinfoil hats \r\n* Introduce an EncryptedCookieJar which is encrypted (and signed) with keys derived from the base secret.\r\n* Default to using the encrypted cookie jar for the session data\r\n\r\nWhat we *don't* have yet, is a configuration option to transparently take an old session, and upgrade it to a new session. Broadly speaking I'm scared of automatic upgrades in crypto systems as I'm too dumb to know if there's an issue here.  It might be nice to have this as an option to encourage people to upgrade, but we'd need some guidance on the sanity, or otherwise, of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f5e3bd3543c15100ad16"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8112#issuecomment-10089199"}
