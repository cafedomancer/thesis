{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5617", "repo": "rails", "body": "*shrug* I don't particularly care if we use a delegate or not.  The method definitions are so simple that using delegate doesn't buy anything in terms of understandability (for me anyway).  The other downside is that using delegate will be less performant than just writing the methods.  I guess a third downside is that it couples the file's dependency on AS.  Probably not a big deal as railties depends on AS, but it would still be nice to keep deps down.  I suppose we could use delegate from stdlib, but it isn't as popular.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's up to you! :-D", "_id": {"$oid": "523eb481bd354364b901206f"}, "issue_id": 5617, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4832235", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5617#issuecomment-4832235", "updated_at": "2012-03-29T21:59:40Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "login": "tenderlove", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-29T21:59:40Z", "id": 4832235, "owner": "rails"}
