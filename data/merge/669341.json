At the moment I am focussing on refactoring/fixing pretty much the whole of the associations code, and then fixing up some outstanding issues with :through associations. I've made some decent progress but there is a way to go yet. As a result my patch is somewhat stale now, so after I've done that I'll update the patch and hopefully we can get it merged. I'll get there eventually :)", "_id": {"$oid": "523869a8bd3543c151012aa3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/121#issuecomment-669341"}
