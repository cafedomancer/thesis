At the moment I am focussing on refactoring/fixing pretty much the whole of the associations code, and then fixing up some outstanding issues with :through associations. I've made some decent progress but there is a way to go yet. As a result my patch is somewhat stale now, so after I've done that I'll update the patch and hopefully we can get it merged. I'll get there eventually :)", "_id": {"$oid": "523869a8bd3543c151012aa3"}, "issue_id": 121, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/669341", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/121#issuecomment-669341", "updated_at": "2011-01-11T15:45:17Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "login": "jonleighton", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-01-11T15:45:17Z", "id": 669341, "owner": "rails"}
