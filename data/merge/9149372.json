{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7797", "repo": "rails", "body": "@rafaelfranca I did some research on `@routes` and `@_routes`. Currently they are both needed and serve the following purpose:\r\n\r\n* \u00b4@routes\u00b4 is the `RouteSet` instance and is only used for testing\r\n* \u00b4@_routes\u00b4 is from `UrlFor`, which is mixed into the `TestCase`. This variable is also used in production\r\n\r\nI could submit a PR to rename `@routes` to `@_route_set`.
