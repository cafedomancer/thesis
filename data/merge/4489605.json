In master, we assume that threads have a 1:1 relationship with connections.  So if you have 100 threads that need to access the database, you should crank the connection pool up to 100.  If you have more worker threads than connections, you need to use a Queue (or some other thread safe data structure) to manage communication between them.  It is not our connection pool's responsibility to manage interprocess communication.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238182abd3543c15100e010"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5423#issuecomment-4489605"}
