A few minor improvements came along:\r\n\r\n1) ```construct_limited_ids_condition``` now uses ```quoted_primary_key```, rather than the unquoted ```primary_key```. I couldn't find any examples where the latter was being interpolated directly into SQL so I'm assuming this is the more correct approach.\r\n2) ```construct_limited_ids_condition``` no longer redundantly ```dup```s the relation before it ```select```s, as the latter will ```clone``` anyway.\r\n3) I'm using the new ```distinct``` methods, rather than ```uniq```", "_id": {"$oid": "52380427bd3543c15100c559"}, "issue_id": 6792, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17068032", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6792#issuecomment-17068032", "updated_at": "2013-04-26T20:03:59Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact", "login": "Empact", "gravatar_id": "b4493ae064e6e2841f376fd1dc12b7ba", "html_url": "https://github.com/Empact", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b4493ae064e6e2841f376fd1dc12b7ba?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbaed9f51d412c2514ee46a0942138ad6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5470, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-04-26T11:28:13Z", "id": 17068032, "owner": "rails"}
