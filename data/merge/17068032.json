A few minor improvements came along:\r\n\r\n1) ```construct_limited_ids_condition``` now uses ```quoted_primary_key```, rather than the unquoted ```primary_key```. I couldn't find any examples where the latter was being interpolated directly into SQL so I'm assuming this is the more correct approach.\r\n2) ```construct_limited_ids_condition``` no longer redundantly ```dup```s the relation before it ```select```s, as the latter will ```clone``` anyway.\r\n3) I'm using the new ```distinct``` methods, rather than ```uniq```", "_id": {"$oid": "52380427bd3543c15100c559"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6792#issuecomment-17068032"}
