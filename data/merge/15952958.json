{"body": "A few more thoughts:\r\n\r\nSince this is the debut of this file, it'd be nice to wrap it all to 80 chars. Since it's not public yet, the history isn't as important.\r\n\r\nA blank line here would be awesome:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* How to test your Action Mailer classes.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now, markdown is interpreting the last one as a section heading because of this. I can't comment on your diff since this line isn't part of it. ;)\r\n\r\n> So we got the mailer, the views, and the tests.\r\n\r\nThis is... sorta tiny. I'm not sure how to expand it, but to start the guide off with what's basically \"Here's some terminal output. Yep.\" isn't super great.\r\n\r\n> #### Edit the Mailer\r\n\r\nThis section doesn't explain _why_ methods in mailers are important. It basically just describes the process of making one, without any of the background info on why you're doing any of this.\r\n\r\n> It is also a good idea to make a text part for this email.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to make this statement stronger, as some people only accept `text/plain` emails. Also, it'd be nice to explain how this process works, ie, multipart.\r\n\r\n> #### Wire It Up So That the System Sends the Email When a User Signs Up\r\n\r\nThis heading is terrible.\r\n\r\n> some people create Rails Observers to fire off emails,\r\n\r\nObservers were removed.\r\n\r\n> Due to this, it makes sense to just have your controller tell the mailer to send an email when a user is successfully created.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to see this whole part get a bit more... forceful. Rather than saying \"well, some people do this, others do this....\" let's cut the hippie bullshit and say \"Send emails in the controller, but you should really be using Resque.\" ;)\r\n\r\n> This provides a much simpler implementation that does not require the registering of observers and the like.\r\n\r\nSame here, observers suck, and if they suck, why do we mention them?\r\n\r\n> Action Mailer now handles \r\n\r\nGuides should always be written as though they're in the present tense. Throw the past down the memory-hole.\r\n\r\n> If you are using UTF-8 as your character set,\r\n\r\nRuby 2 does this by default, I'd like to add a caveat for 1.9 rather than present 'if' as the norm. \"Strongly recommend 2.0\" and all that.\r\n\r\n> * Defining a header field as a parameter to the `mail` method:\r\n\r\nIf we're going to suggest custom headers, [X-* has been deprecated](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648), so we shouldn't encourage that pattern.\r\n\r\n> Adding attachments has been simplified in Action Mailer 3.0.\r\n\r\nSame deal. 3.0? Who cares?\r\n\r\n> pre-encode\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBo3-XnhXNM\r\n\r\n> Action Mailer 3.0 \r\n\r\nSame deal here.\r\n\r\n> Firstly, to tell Mail\r\n\r\nWait, what's Mail?\r\n\r\n> `attachments[]` as a hash\r\n\r\nshould drop the []s.\r\n\r\n> Thus, when using named routes only the \"_url\" variant makes sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sentence is really awkward.\r\n\r\n> It is also possible to set a default host that will be used in all mailers by setting the `:host` option as a configuration option in `config/application.rb`:\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't be at the end, it should be at the beginning. Why tell people to add `:host` to every `_url` call when they should set it globally?\r\n\r\n>  prepopulate\r\n\r\nSee George Carlin above\r\n\r\n> Abstract Controller\r\n\r\nShould be `AbstractController`.\r\n\r\n> GMail\r\n\r\nGmail.\r\n\r\n>   domain:               'baci.lindsaar.net',\r\n\r\nBest to use `example.com` for all sample domains.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThat's all I got for now.
