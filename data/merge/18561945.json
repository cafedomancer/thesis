This is the current behavior:\r\n```\r\nActiveRecord::SchemaMigration.create_table\r\nActiveRecord::SchemaMigration.table_exists? # returns false in rails master\r\nActiveRecord::Base.connection.table_exists?(ActiveRecord::SchemaMigration.table_name) # returns true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change makes table_exists? work as expected by bypassing schema_cache.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dbdabd3543c15100890e"}, "issue_id": 10766, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18561945", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10766#issuecomment-18561945", "updated_at": "2013-05-28T16:22:48Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerippey/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerippey/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerippey/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerippey/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerippey", "login": "kylerippey", "gravatar_id": "253b44b8a63c0d30cc806b9e6f2d11c7", "html_url": "https://github.com/kylerippey", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerippey/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerippey/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerippey/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/253b44b8a63c0d30cc806b9e6f2d11c7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc7241f081d2b759f463f19ab82712c29.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerippey/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 627901, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kylerippey/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-28T16:21:03Z", "id": 18561945, "owner": "rails"}
