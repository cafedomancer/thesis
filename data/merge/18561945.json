{"body": "@aditya-kapoor Here is the benchmark I ran, using the same pattern as activerecord/examples/performance.rb: https://gist.github.com/kylerippey/5663887\r\n\r\nI performed three runs on each branch with the following results:\r\n**master**\r\n747.8 (\u00b17.4%) i/s -      14874 in  20.003392s\r\n741.0 (\u00b18.6%) i/s -      14697 in  19.993949s\r\n768.5 (\u00b17.4%) i/s -      15264 in  19.975956s\r\nAverage: 752.43 i/s\r\n\r\n**minor_schema_migration_refactor**\r\n744.2 (\u00b17.9%) i/s -      14784 in  20.000572s\r\n746.9 (\u00b17.8%) i/s -      14839 in  19.993636s\r\n766.9 (\u00b17.6%) i/s -      15264 in  20.020892s\r\nAverage: 752.67 i/s\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I noticed that \"SchemaMigration.table_exists?\" does not currently work as expected in rails master due to the fact that the ActiveRecord::Base implementation is passed through schema_cache.
