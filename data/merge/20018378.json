In your situation, you could even achieve the same by rescuing for `RuntimeError` and checking the error message for `delegated to` or something like that, although I'd not recommend.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd recommend, though, would be to write some internal module which handles integrating with the third party apis and defining/delegating attributes for you, which would raise a very specific and well named error message for such scenarios, such as `ThirdPartyMissingAttribute` or something like that. This way it'd be very clear for anyone looking at that code *why* you're rescuing that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I guess I'd not mind having a specific `DelegationError` class since it'd also help others identify possible errors with delegation, so I don't have a strong opinion on whether this should be merged or not.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523cacfabd354364b900219c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10828#issuecomment-20018378"}
