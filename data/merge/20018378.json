{"body": "I agree with the overall idea of not using exceptions for control flow. In your situation, you could even achieve the same by rescuing for `RuntimeError` and checking the error message for `delegated to` or something like that, although I'd not recommend.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd recommend, though, would be to write some internal module which handles integrating with the third party apis and defining/delegating attributes for you, which would raise a very specific and well named error message for such scenarios, such as `ThirdPartyMissingAttribute` or something like that. This way it'd be very clear for anyone looking at that code *why* you're rescuing that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I guess I'd not mind having a specific `DelegationError` class since it'd also help others identify possible errors with delegation, so I don't have a strong opinion on whether this should be merged or not.\r\n\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20018378", "created_at": "2013-06-26T00:12:11Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10828#issuecomment-20018378", "updated_at": "2013-06-26T00:12:11Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 10828, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "type": "User", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523cacfabd354364b900219c"}, "id": 20018378, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10828"}
