Usually you don't commit to your master branch and leave it just for sync. So when you want to sync your fork with Rails master, you do:\n\n    # Get changes from Rails\n    git pull --rebase rails master\n\n    # Push changes to your fork\n    git push origin master\n\n    # Then you can also go to your branches and rebase\n    git checkout my_feature\n    git rebase master\n\nIs this what you have asked?", "_id": {"$oid": "52386077bd3543c151012274"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/423#issuecomment-1115665"}
