I don't expect many people to ever use this parameter because the default value is usually what you want. It would break backwards compatibility to change this though. \r\n\r\nSo I can add it as a third parameter which requires people to explicitly provide any time they want to change the serializer, or do some magic parameter type detection to make this work. I like neither of these solutions, but I will implement whatever you think is the best of those two evils :).", "_id": {"$oid": "52383bd5bd3543c151010336"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3031#issuecomment-2106550"}
