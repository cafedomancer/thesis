{"body": "The problem with this is that the second parameter is already in use for the hash/encryption algorithm to use. I don't expect many people to ever use this parameter because the default value is usually what you want. It would break backwards compatibility to change this though. \r\n\r\nSo I can add it as a third parameter which requires people to explicitly provide any time they want to change the serializer, or do some magic parameter type detection to make this work. I like neither of these solutions, but I will implement whatever you think is the best of those two evils :).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2106550", "created_at": "2011-09-15T17:07:09Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3031#issuecomment-2106550", "updated_at": "2011-09-15T17:08:38Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3031, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wvanbergen/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wvanbergen/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wvanbergen/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wvanbergen", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wvanbergen/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/wvanbergen", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wvanbergen/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ed5d98f3a41d99feee05c758ae751739?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F86317a3269e7927536b010c2615aeab5.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wvanbergen/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wvanbergen/received_events", "gravatar_id": "ed5d98f3a41d99feee05c758ae751739", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wvanbergen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "wvanbergen", "type": "User", "id": 15870, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wvanbergen/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383bd5bd3543c151010336"}, "id": 2106550, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3031"}
