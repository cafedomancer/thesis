Also, it wouldn't need two keys.\r\n\r\nI guess there's not much chance of incompatible changes being pulled, is there?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e15fbd3543c151008f96"}, "issue_id": 10235, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16617714", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10235#issuecomment-16617714", "updated_at": "2013-04-18T22:56:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jleis/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jleis/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jleis/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jleis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jleis", "login": "jleis", "gravatar_id": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/jleis", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jleis/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jleis/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jleis/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://identicons.github.com/1d7a05b07251ba147253c6714637891f.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jleis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 158182, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jleis/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-04-18T22:56:12Z", "id": 16617714, "owner": "rails"}
