I think your fix is ok, but I wouldn't change the tests we actually have because meanwhile you don't have an asset_path named route everything should still work ok.\r\nSo can you leave the tests the way they are and add new ones where you have an asset_path named route and calling each of the methods you modified shows how after your patch everything still works?.\r\nPlease squash the commits :).\r\nThanks.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238368ebd3543c15100fd6c"}, "issue_id": 3428, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3004949", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3428#issuecomment-3004949", "updated_at": "2011-12-04T05:18:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/spastorino", "login": "spastorino", "gravatar_id": "d04d064616ae7fd752fdcb8daa5abdd6", "html_url": "https://github.com/spastorino", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/d04d064616ae7fd752fdcb8daa5abdd6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F960fc72b306e2c9879dbeaa4f765dad2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 52642, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spastorino/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-04T05:18:27Z", "id": 3004949, "owner": "rails"}
