I think your fix is ok, but I wouldn't change the tests we actually have because meanwhile you don't have an asset_path named route everything should still work ok.\r\nSo can you leave the tests the way they are and add new ones where you have an asset_path named route and calling each of the methods you modified shows how after your patch everything still works?.\r\nPlease squash the commits :).\r\nThanks.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238368ebd3543c15100fd6c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3428#issuecomment-3004949"}
