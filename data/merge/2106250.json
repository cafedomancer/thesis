So the default would be:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nActiveSupport::MessageVerifier.new(\"Hey, I'm a secret!\", Marshal)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA JSON serializer would be:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nclass JSONSerializer\r\n  def load(value)\r\n    ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(value)\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def dump(value)\r\n    ActiveSupport::JSON.encode(value)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is better because:\r\n\r\n* It relies on only one parameter, rather than two\r\n* The parameter is set in the initializer. I don't think the serialization strategy should change once the object has been created.\r\n* The `load`/`dump` requirement is the same as the new `serialize` API in Active Record, so the same serialization objects could be used.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383bd5bd3543c151010334"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3031#issuecomment-2106250"}
