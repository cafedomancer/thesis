{"body": "Hey, I know this has already been merged now, but I think a better API would be:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nActiveSupport::MessageVerifier.new(\"Hey, I'm a secret!\", serializer)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `serializer` is an object that responds to `load` and `dump`. So the default would be:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nActiveSupport::MessageVerifier.new(\"Hey, I'm a secret!\", Marshal)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA JSON serializer would be:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nclass JSONSerializer\r\n  def load(value)\r\n    ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(value)\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def dump(value)\r\n    ActiveSupport::JSON.encode(value)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is better because:\r\n\r\n* It relies on only one parameter, rather than two\r\n* The parameter is set in the initializer. I don't think the serialization strategy should change once the object has been created.\r\n* The `load`/`dump` requirement is the same as the new `serialize` API in Active Record, so the same serialization objects could be used.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2106250", "created_at": "2011-09-15T16:36:31Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3031#issuecomment-2106250", "updated_at": "2011-09-15T16:36:31Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3031, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jonleighton", "type": "User", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383bd5bd3543c151010334"}, "id": 2106250, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3031"}
