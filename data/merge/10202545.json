{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8060", "repo": "rails", "body": "@senny I pulled your code and played around with it a bit we should change this message a little:\r\n\r\n1)\r\n\r\nWe should put quotes or something around the adapters to make them stand out a bit more. Also `postgres` is not the name of the adapter it is `postgresql` (sigh) so I would like to see the error message like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf you use an adapter other than  'postgresql', 'mysql', 'mysql2', or 'sqlite3' add the necessary adapter gem to your Gemfile. (LoadError)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be **killer** to tell them the adapter name they specified here. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSpecified 'posgreql' for database adapter without adding the necessary gem in your Gemfile. Did you mean   'postgresql', 'mysql', 'mysql2', or 'sqlite3' ? (LoadError)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor wording with these types of messages I like to tell facts in addition to giving instructions. This helps developers to understand not only how to fix the error, but why they got it in the first place. So maybe instead of\r\n\r\n```\r\nto use the postgresql adapter you need to add: gem 'pg' to your Gemfile. (Gem::LoadError)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could do this: \r\n\r\n```\r\nSpecified 'postgresql' for database adapter, but the gem is not loaded. Add `gem 'pg'` to your Gemfile (Gem::LoadError)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) By other places, i meant we could maybe look into having the `pg` gem register several adapter names such as `pg` and `postgres` in addition to `postgresql`. I don't know what this would entail, but it would be a nice to have.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm liking the work here :heart:, take a look at my wording, ping me if you push up changes and you want me to take a look.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f644bd3543c15100ade6"}, "issue_id": 8060, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10202545", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8060#issuecomment-10202545", "updated_at": "2012-11-08T20:02:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems", "login": "schneems", "gravatar_id": "db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e", "html_url": "https://github.com/schneems", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ef42a6eab211ddd71ac423a80b42d15.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 59744, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-08T20:02:42Z", "id": 10202545, "owner": "rails"}
