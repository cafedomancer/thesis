{"body": "Nice patch! There are a couple things we need to have in mind though:\r\n\r\n1) If we are going to make this approach the default, it needs to be turned on via a flag, otherwise it will break backwards compatibility;\r\n\r\n2) When you use a generator to generate a migration, we already include indexes for each belongs_to/references. So if we are merging this patch, we need to reevaluate our current migration generator.\r\n\r\nMy $0.02: this patch adds a simpler syntax to add indexes which is welcome but I wouldn't make this the default. I would simply improve the current generators.\r\n\r\n/cc @jeremy @tenderlove ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4308643", "created_at": "2012-03-04T09:41:03Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5262#issuecomment-4308643", "updated_at": "2012-03-04T09:41:03Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5262, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ed3aebd354364b90131c0"}, "id": 4308643, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5262"}
