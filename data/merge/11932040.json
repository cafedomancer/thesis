There doesn't appear to be an obvious way to test that the default lookup behavior happens in those tests. \r\n\r\nThe `controller/layout_test.rb` tests are what actually verifies the changes and checks that the default layout lookup behavior is used when a symbol or proc returns nil.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d8a30bd354364b9007b89"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8458#issuecomment-11932040"}
