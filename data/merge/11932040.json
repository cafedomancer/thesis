There doesn't appear to be an obvious way to test that the default lookup behavior happens in those tests. \r\n\r\nThe `controller/layout_test.rb` tests are what actually verifies the changes and checks that the default layout lookup behavior is used when a symbol or proc returns nil.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d8a30bd354364b9007b89"}, "issue_id": 8458, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11932040", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8458#issuecomment-11932040", "updated_at": "2013-01-06T18:28:44Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola", "login": "chrisnicola", "gravatar_id": "e2a523100c5d3d437a585962e7cfd625", "html_url": "https://github.com/chrisnicola", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e2a523100c5d3d437a585962e7cfd625?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F90388c2eb2fb04b5f6aed006b56440a3.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 156449, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-06T18:28:44Z", "id": 11932040, "owner": "rails"}
