{"body": "@trevorturk there are two use cases so far.\r\n\r\n1. When you have constraints, you have exactly the same route but have different endpoints based on constraints. The route name and route url are exactly the same though.\r\n\r\n    ```elixir\r\n    authenticate(:user) do\r\n      root to: \"private_home#index\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    root to: \"public_home#index\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Engines use the `routes.append` mechanism to add routes at the end. This is convenient because you can override any engine endpoint by simply declaring your route first. This makes it a bit harder.\r\n\r\nDefining a route first is a way to give some route higher priority. Raising on such route conflicts is similar to raising when a method is redefined in a class. It may be an accident but they are also legit cases where you would want to do it.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17299420", "created_at": "2013-05-01T19:00:15Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-17299420", "updated_at": "2013-05-01T19:00:29Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9704, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b900469e"}, "id": 17299420, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9704"}
