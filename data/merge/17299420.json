When you have constraints, you have exactly the same route but have different endpoints based on constraints. The route name and route url are exactly the same though.\r\n\r\n    ```elixir\r\n    authenticate(:user) do\r\n      root to: \"private_home#index\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    root to: \"public_home#index\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Engines use the `routes.append` mechanism to add routes at the end. This is convenient because you can override any engine endpoint by simply declaring your route first. This makes it a bit harder.\r\n\r\nDefining a route first is a way to give some route higher priority. Raising on such route conflicts is similar to raising when a method is redefined in a class. It may be an accident but they are also legit cases where you would want to do it.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b900469e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-17299420"}
