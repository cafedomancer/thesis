When you have constraints, you have exactly the same route but have different endpoints based on constraints. The route name and route url are exactly the same though.\r\n\r\n    ```elixir\r\n    authenticate(:user) do\r\n      root to: \"private_home#index\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    root to: \"public_home#index\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Engines use the `routes.append` mechanism to add routes at the end. This is convenient because you can override any engine endpoint by simply declaring your route first. This makes it a bit harder.\r\n\r\nDefining a route first is a way to give some route higher priority. Raising on such route conflicts is similar to raising when a method is redefined in a class. It may be an accident but they are also legit cases where you would want to do it.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b900469e"}, "issue_id": 9704, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17299420", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-17299420", "updated_at": "2013-05-01T19:00:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-01T19:00:15Z", "id": 17299420, "owner": "rails"}
