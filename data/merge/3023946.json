Imagine a database with a million tables. Do you want to ask the database if that one table exists, or pull down the entire list of a million tables, and then store that whole list of tables, and query against it?\r\n\r\nThat said, I totally understand your distaste for swallowing the exceptions. I see two possibilities: either we could add a comment encouraging the database adapters to override with a db specific version that does not swallow the exception, or we could just only implement this in the adapters. \r\n\r\nWhich sounds better to you?", "_id": {"$oid": "52383084bd3543c15100f66b"}, "issue_id": 3867, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3023946", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3867#issuecomment-3023946", "updated_at": "2011-12-05T21:43:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest", "login": "jadeforrest", "gravatar_id": "f4f2aaf70e80b1df127ceeb88bb71905", "html_url": "https://github.com/jadeforrest", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f4f2aaf70e80b1df127ceeb88bb71905?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe64b59fdac91e05c2c2e8a8cb0933f0b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 167022, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jadeforrest/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-05T21:43:51Z", "id": 3023946, "owner": "rails"}
