I see two possibilities: either we could add a comment encouraging the database adapters to override with a db specific version that does not swallow the exception, or we could just only implement this in the adapters. \r\n\r\nWhich sounds better to you?", "_id": {"$oid": "52383084bd3543c15100f66b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3867#issuecomment-3023946"}
