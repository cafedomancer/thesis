Perhaps the removal of the functionality should be pointed out--or if it's agreed that it's up to the user to implement their own race_condition_ttl functionality, shouldn't it also be yanked from ActiveSupport::Cache#fetch?\r\n\r\nFinally, if ActiveSupport::Cache isn't keeping its own tabs on the expires_in, and modifying that value to avoid multiple concurrent fetches on a key miss, why wrap the cached value in an Entity instance at all?  The overhead with the extra marshaling and compressing (Dalli also will marshal and compress the value sent to it) just doesn't seem worth it.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7bcbd3543c15100b10d"}, "issue_id": 7913, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9380073", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7913#issuecomment-9380073", "updated_at": "2012-10-12T15:27:58Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mje113/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mje113/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mje113/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mje113/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mje113", "login": "mje113", "gravatar_id": "2c17b677625ca6499a2d9ea2ca724873", "html_url": "https://github.com/mje113", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mje113/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mje113/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mje113/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2c17b677625ca6499a2d9ea2ca724873?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0342c9a7b54450830e9727b98f8e3cb7.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mje113/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5011, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mje113/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-12T15:27:58Z", "id": 9380073, "owner": "rails"}
