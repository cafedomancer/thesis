I'll make the changes mentioned by @josevalim to keep certain concerns in NumberHelper, I'll rename the instance methods to to_s, and I'll fix the method protection of the class method.  And I will update the AS guide, per the request by @fxn.\n\nRegarding a way to avoid having class versions of each, I'm open to suggestions.  In order to support things like \"number_to_currency('123a456') => $123a456\" (which there are explicit tests for), we need to be able to have methods that operate on strings (as @josevalim correctly pointed out).  I considered having only instance methods and having an option that could be passed to include a string (like 0.to_currency(:number =>  \"123a456\") => $123a456), but that seemed uglier than class methods.  Any suggestions here are welcome.\n\nI'll update the pull request with the changes in a day or two.
