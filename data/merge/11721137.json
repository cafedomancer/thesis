This way different database adapter implementations could overwrite the method to reserve a different amount of characters. We could even reserve a different amount of characters for index name, than for a table name. I guess there are also databases which do not need the renaming where we could leave the limit as is.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d7baabd354364b9007340"}, "issue_id": 8613, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11721137", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8613#issuecomment-11721137", "updated_at": "2012-12-27T23:32:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "login": "senny", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-27T23:24:59Z", "id": 11721137, "owner": "rails"}
