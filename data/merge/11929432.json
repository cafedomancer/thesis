{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8777", "repo": "rails", "body": "> I think it's important to keep Rails sources as clean as possible \u2014 a lot of people use them to study Rails internals or just get better at Ruby generally, so the usage of as many own features as possible makes the sources feel consistent.\r\n\r\nTrust me, there are better resources for getting learning Ruby :smile:\r\n\r\nI'd hate to think that people are copying how we do things - Rails has a very special set of requirements that anyone developing Rails applications doesn't need to worry about. For example I know Rails is often criticised for not maintaining backwards compatibility but we do try not break people's apps unnecessarily and this can leave code being quite messy at times.\r\n\r\n> I'm seeing a lot of inconsistency in Rails currently.\r\n\r\nI think that's inevitable given the number of contributors, the fact that we're all volunteers and that it's been around for so long now. A lot of the inconsistency is purely subjective and changes over time - for example your change has only been possible for a couple of months and the code you changed predates then.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237efefbd3543c15100a1f4"}, "issue_id": 8777, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11929432", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8777#issuecomment-11929432", "updated_at": "2013-01-06T15:02:24Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-06T15:02:24Z", "id": 11929432, "owner": "rails"}
