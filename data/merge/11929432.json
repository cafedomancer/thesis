For example I know Rails is often criticised for not maintaining backwards compatibility but we do try not break people's apps unnecessarily and this can leave code being quite messy at times.\r\n\r\n> I'm seeing a lot of inconsistency in Rails currently.\r\n\r\nI think that's inevitable given the number of contributors, the fact that we're all volunteers and that it's been around for so long now. A lot of the inconsistency is purely subjective and changes over time - for example your change has only been possible for a couple of months and the code you changed predates then.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237efefbd3543c15100a1f4"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8777#issuecomment-11929432"}
