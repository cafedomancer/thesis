I will list them and then discuss a possible solution:\r\n\r\n1) I don't like the @@to_path variable cache. The simplest solution is to move the logic to the class and simply cache using @_to_path. Depending on model_name isn't also a good idea as @Peeja pointed out.\r\n\r\n2) This change will also affect performance on the partial renderer.\r\n\r\nSo I want to point a solution that won't require deprecation and provide the same feature. Let's simply change PartialRenderer to check if the object respond to the method \"to_partial_path\", if so, it will simply call this method, if not, it will use the logic we have today, including the HASH cache we have in the partial renderer.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?", "_id": {"$oid": "523fe3a4bd354364b901bfa5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2034#issuecomment-1550472"}
