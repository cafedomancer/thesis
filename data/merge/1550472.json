{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2034", "repo": "rails", "body": "Ok, thanks for your work guys but there are some issues in this pull request. I will list them and then discuss a possible solution:\r\n\r\n1) I don't like the @@to_path variable cache. The simplest solution is to move the logic to the class and simply cache using @_to_path. Depending on model_name isn't also a good idea as @Peeja pointed out.\r\n\r\n2) This change will also affect performance on the partial renderer.\r\n\r\nSo I want to point a solution that won't require deprecation and provide the same feature. Let's simply change PartialRenderer to check if the object respond to the method \"to_partial_path\", if so, it will simply call this method, if not, it will use the logic we have today, including the HASH cache we have in the partial renderer.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?", "_id": {"$oid": "523fe3a4bd354364b901bfa5"}, "issue_id": 2034, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1550472", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2034#issuecomment-1550472", "updated_at": "2011-07-11T22:17:33Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-07-11T22:17:33Z", "id": 1550472, "owner": "rails"}
