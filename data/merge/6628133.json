{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6626", "repo": "rails", "body": "Yes it's not affected to `render :template`. But formats for template is set once here https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_view/renderer/template_renderer.rb#L12\nAnd after, all `render` calls will use the same format. But for partials we should not totally replace formats, we should add another one. And if I render :json partial at the beginning I also can render :html partial already after :json. That's why I've added format's adding to setup method and that's why we should do it each render partial in my opinion. I think share the same fix is impossible, also in my opinion.
