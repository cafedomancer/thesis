{"body": "Yes it's not affected to `render :template`. But formats for template is set once here https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_view/renderer/template_renderer.rb#L12\nAnd after, all `render` calls will use the same format.

That's why I've added format's adding to setup method and that's why we should do it each render partial in my opinion. I think share the same fix is impossible, also in my opinion.
