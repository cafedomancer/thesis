First was that version runs as much as 10% faster than what is currently on master. However, the test case of adding a handler for Regexp became a good bit uglier, as it now required monkey-patching core classes to add support for one.\r\n\r\n@jferris, as for use cases, I believe @joannecheng had a good one she ran into recently involving using PostGIS and a Location class. I've got a few ideas for some utility class gems that would be much less hacky with this sort of support. (For example, a currency class that normalized whether the database column was an int or float, and always came out as an integer in cents, with a few presentation helpers). We'd also be able to do things like database side encryption much more easily.
