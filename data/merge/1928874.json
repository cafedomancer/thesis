See discussion in aa1d1e4962ba218f34defd0e7f0b665c795eb12b.\r\n\r\nAs you say, we have to deal with writer methods to make this work. My implementation dealt with this by backporting `public_send` for 1.8. However, the backport needed some more work and in any case would have had performance difficulties I think.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to do a special case for writer methods, but they wouldn't be able to deal with more than one argument, without a backport of `public_send`. IMO it would be best to just not let delegate work with writer methods + multiple args (it's a very very edge case).\r\n\r\nBut anyway, given the opposition to this change (see discussion in the commit linked) and the various complications with implementing it, I lost interest and reverted.\r\n\r\nBy all means feel free to try to persuade people and suggest an implementation, but I am just letting you know that I've already been down the road and gave up ;)", "_id": {"$oid": "523840ecbd3543c151010957"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2711#issuecomment-1928874"}
