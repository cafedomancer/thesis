Hoping we can get it into 3-1-stable too to be on the safe side since it's almost a security issue, but will understand if we're only maintaining one version back as usual.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9, I see that a while back you contributed a test which *almost* caught this bug - test_just_using_flash_does_not_stream_a_cookie_back.  Frustratingly, although the test is useful, the buggy code didn't fail this test because it only triggered the session cookie on the response if the request had both a session cookie and a flash key in it:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n      if (session = env['rack.session']) && (flash = session['flash'])\r\n        flash.sweep\r\n      end\r\n```\r\n\r\n(obviously users will have this if they have hit other actions first, even if this request doesn't use the session.)\r\n\r\nSo I am trying to adapt that test to set the session cookie up properly but struggling a bit.  @dragus, I'd love some help with this, thanks!\r\n\r\nBasically all I want to add to the above test is request.session['flash'] = {:foo => :bar}.  But this being a framework test rather than a controller test, request.session isn't set up, nor is request.cookie_jar to set request.cookie_jar.signed[SessionKey] directly.  \r\n\r\nAny ideas?  I'd really like to avoid coping in all the session cookie code because it feels to me like that would be a very brittle test that would stop testing anything useful when the session code is changed.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380fd5bd3543c15100d5b1"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6034#issuecomment-5404764"}
