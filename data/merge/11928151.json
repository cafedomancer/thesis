{"body": "Thanks for merging :smile: Though, I think it's important to keep Rails sources as clean as possible \u2014 a lot of people use them to study Rails internals or just get better at Ruby generally, so the usage of as many own features as possible makes the sources feel consistent. \r\n\r\nI'm seeing a lot of inconsistency in Rails currently. It's mostly small things, but that's what makes an impression of code quality. Starting from `'self.class` vs `:class` in `delegate` to different indentation styles around `private`/`protected` keywords to use of either `&:name` or `{ |u| u.name}` to different hash syntaxes. This list is actually even longer.\r\n\r\nI think Rails should be example of consistent and elegant Ruby code which others can learn from.
