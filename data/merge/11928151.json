It's mostly small things, but that's what makes an impression of code quality. Starting from `'self.class` vs `:class` in `delegate` to different indentation styles around `private`/`protected` keywords to use of either `&:name` or `{ |u| u.name}` to different hash syntaxes. This list is actually even longer.\r\n\r\nI think Rails should be example of consistent and elegant Ruby code which others can learn from. That is my point.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237efefbd3543c15100a1f3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8777#issuecomment-11928151"}
