{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1756", "repo": "rails", "body": "I think it would be better if you clone that test case and make it as another test case instead. In that case, we can be sured that you didn't break the old test. ;)\r\n\r\nAlso, if you don't mind please squash your patch into single commit. In that case if anything goes wrong we can `git bisect` on the tree. If you separate the commit, it would be hard for us to tell if this commit is really a failure point or a failing test case commit.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!! You can then update and force-push to your branch.
