{"body": "It took a while for me to digest finding and running the right tests. I'm still not 100% sure I've done the right thing here. I thought I needed to add to railties/test/application/runner_test.rb but now I think that the test at https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/8d01c61129217d48eeb4ae7afe04a5e98aad9ba0 is actually all I need. The only thing I'm concerned about is that the issue https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/7683 doesn't mention rake, so adding a test to railties/test/application/rake_test.rb didn't seem right to me at first.\n\nI did my best to confirm that the test fails before the backports, and passes after the backports. Please let me know if I've done anything wrong here, and I'll try to fix it.\n\n/ping @kennyj @rafaelfranca ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8717611", "created_at": "2012-09-20T06:05:54Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7695#issuecomment-8717611", "updated_at": "2012-09-20T06:05:54Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7695, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benolee/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benolee/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benolee/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/benolee", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benolee/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/benolee", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benolee/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/c69aac6da04a0bd37d2d4f5e3aa678e3?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fef06a2cec0e214c08342b615c8ee7831.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benolee/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benolee/received_events", "gravatar_id": "c69aac6da04a0bd37d2d4f5e3aa678e3", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benolee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "benolee", "type": "User", "id": 384535, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benolee/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523dd086bd354364b900a646"}, "id": 8717611, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7695"}
