However, since its the proficient rubyists we are talking about -- I personally think their needs would have been better served by a [custom application template](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/rails_application_templates.html) but since that PR(#8468) has already been merged & shipped. lets accept that this is the direction we would be going -- internal controllers.\r\n\r\nComing back to topic,\r\nI was hit by this Dev Vs Prod mismatch today(#11502) & ended up wasting an hour debugging.  if Development & Pro Env are identical, such silly issues can be prevented in future.
