{"body": "The current solution makes use of the `Gem::LoadError` raised by the adapters to provide two separate error messages:\r\n\r\n1. adapter file can't be found: `could not load 'active_record/connection_adapters/postgres_adapter'. Make sure that the adapter in your database.yml is valid. If you use an adapter other than mysql, mysql2, postgres or sqlite3 add the necessary adapter gem to your Gemfile.`\r\n1. adapter file was found but missing dependencies prevent it from being loaded: `to use the postgres adapter you need to add: gem 'pg' to your Gemfile.`\r\n\r\n@schneems what kind of output would you like to see? I think the wording could be improved. Also what other places do you see to adress the issue?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10162894", "created_at": "2012-11-07T20:05:45Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8060#issuecomment-10162894", "updated_at": "2012-11-07T20:05:45Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8060, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "senny", "type": "User", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f644bd3543c15100ade5"}, "id": 10162894, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8060"}
