{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6463", "repo": "rails", "body": "@tenderlove the main problem is all specific to mysql2 -- the conflict between mysql2's `wait_timeout` and ConnectionPool's was the main problem, which existed in 3-2-stable and master. That was the real problem which was horrible, the reaper/checkout_timeout was something subsidiary it just made sense to clean up as long as it was being changed. \n\nIf someone decides what the \"right\" behavior in 3-2-stable is, I can prepare a backported pull. Would probably do it from scratch rather than try to cherry-pick, since the implemetnation has changed enough. But it's not at all clear to me what the right thing to do in 3-2-stable is, with backwards compat concerns.
