Lets me explain a simple usage case:\r\n\r\nThere are some minimal CSS compressors like CSSMin by Ryan Grove that only has one file: https://gist.github.com/1106101\r\n\r\nUsing the proposed API I can save this compressor to lib/cssmin.rb in my app and register it easily without have to write a 'cssmin-rails' plugin:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nSprockets::Railtie.register_css_compressor(:cssmin, CSSMin)\r\nconfig.assets.css_compressor = :cssmin\r\n```\r\n\r\nThink that this is something like ActionView::Template::Handlers that has an API used by Haml, Slim, etc but also allows you register your custom handlers classes (or procs)", "_id": {"$oid": "52384600bd3543c151010e78"}, "issue_id": 2246, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1652105", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2246#issuecomment-1652105", "updated_at": "2011-07-27T06:21:08Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran", "login": "guilleiguaran", "gravatar_id": "73d57855a3bfe5c534596197a895ab6e", "html_url": "https://github.com/guilleiguaran", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/73d57855a3bfe5c534596197a895ab6e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ffa159acecc4c559601c9a2fc35c75213.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 160941, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-07-26T06:59:26Z", "id": 1652105, "owner": "rails"}
