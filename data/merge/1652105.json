Lets me explain a simple usage case:\r\n\r\nThere are some minimal CSS compressors like CSSMin by Ryan Grove that only has one file: https://gist.github.com/1106101\r\n\r\nUsing the proposed API I can save this compressor to lib/cssmin.rb in my app and register it easily without have to write a 'cssmin-rails' plugin:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nSprockets::Railtie.register_css_compressor(:cssmin, CSSMin)\r\nconfig.assets.css_compressor = :cssmin\r\n```\r\n\r\nThink that this is something like ActionView::Template::Handlers that has an API used by Haml, Slim, etc but also allows you register your custom handlers classes (or procs)", "_id": {"$oid": "52384600bd3543c151010e78"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2246#issuecomment-1652105"}
