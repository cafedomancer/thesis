And yes, it was supposed to be fixed in future versions of Rails, but the problem has been around for some time already and no possible fix appeared up to now :). Anyway, it's not completely settled to be removed forever, we can always fix and revert the merge, so lets focus our work on that to get it back on master now that we see that people are using it and willing to fix :).", "_id": {"$oid": "523ed417bd354364b901320b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5261#issuecomment-4588480"}
