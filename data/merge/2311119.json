How do you think the sprocket guys would feel about a request to expose an option?\r\n\r\n> The other reason for re-invocation is to ensure that the `RAILS_GROUPS` and `RAILS_ENV` environment variables are set up correctly for asset compilation. No real way round this that I've been able to come up with yet.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to manually load the production environment config to feed it into sprockets? I persoanlly have no idea what `RAILS_GROUPS` is, so I'll look into this.\r\n\r\n> These are generated for use by static pages (error pages for example) or in emails. Their use is somewhat of an edge case (IMHO) but necessary when you're in a situation where you have no idea what the digested name is.\r\n\r\nGood point. Personally I would simply expose a rake task `assets:precompile:nondigest` so people needing this can run manually.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383942bd3543c1510100a3"}, "issue_id": 3225, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2311119", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3225#issuecomment-2311119", "updated_at": "2011-10-06T15:28:48Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomasfedb/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomasfedb/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomasfedb/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomasfedb/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomasfedb", "login": "thomasfedb", "gravatar_id": "aa1aefd297451de8c9992e3d52621804", "html_url": "https://github.com/thomasfedb", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomasfedb/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomasfedb/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomasfedb/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/aa1aefd297451de8c9992e3d52621804?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2b644053f51096f77328548c15d942fb.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomasfedb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 193831, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomasfedb/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-10-06T15:28:48Z", "id": 2311119, "owner": "rails"}
