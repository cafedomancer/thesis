And in case we go this path, the test would need to be updated to reflect that the errors stay there after calling `dup`.\n\n@josevalim @rafaelfranca how does that look for you guys?\n\nThanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "523e688fbd354364b900fde6"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6284#issuecomment-5679645"}
