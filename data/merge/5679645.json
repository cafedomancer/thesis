{"body": "I'm leaning toward actually cloning the `@errors` object instead of nullifying it, would look something like:\n\n```ruby\n@errors = other.errors.dup\n@errors.instance_variable_set(:@base, self)\n```\n\nSeems more what `initialize_dup` is supposed to do, I just dislike a bit the `instance_variable_set` call (although the test would break in case anything changes in `Errors`). And in case we go this path, the test would need to be updated to reflect that the errors stay there after calling `dup`.\n\n@josevalim @rafaelfranca how does that look for you guys?\n\nThanks!", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5679645", "created_at": "2012-05-13T21:23:36Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6284#issuecomment-5679645", "updated_at": "2012-05-13T21:23:36Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6284, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "type": "User", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e688fbd354364b900fde6"}, "id": 5679645, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6284"}
