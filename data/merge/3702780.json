Because mswin32 version of ruby installed rake.bat instead of rake with shebang line and rake.bat is bat file (special type of windows shell script) embeded ruby script in it.\r\nThe patch makes re-launch command line as 'ruby.exe rake.bat assets:precompile'. Then ruby will read bat file directly and makes error : PATH/rake.bat:1: syntax error, unexpected tIDENTIFIER, expecting $end\r\nHere is fixed version of the patch.   https://gist.github.com/1695503\r\n\r\nI wonder if you pull the patch, thanks.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383a7fbd3543c1510101b5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3121#issuecomment-3702780"}
