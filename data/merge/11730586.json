I put the assertions in place to reflect the current situation but I did not actually change any functionality. I created tasks on my todo-list for the following work (will submit PRs later):\r\n\r\n* rename indexes on rename_column\r\n* clarify the behavior of remove_column with multi-column indices\r\n\r\nThis PR can be merged. I'll work on the other tasks after the bugfix #8613\r\n\r\n@rafaelfranca could you review the changes? I used `if current_adapter?(:PostgreSQLAdapter)` to make the different behavior of PostgreSQL visible.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d7a13bd354364b90071ed"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8636#issuecomment-11730586"}
