I've removed the unnecessary check of the args.size.\n\nRegarding removing the i18n load_path file stuff, just to be clear, this will mean that if you cherry pick this single file from ActiveSupport and load it alone, these methods won't work properly.  According to @fxn, people should be able to load a single file in AS and have it work.\n\nLet me know what you'd like me to do with the i18n stuff, and if the methods should be named to_formatted_s instead.\n\nThanks again for all the feedback!", "_id": {"$oid": "523e6611bd354364b900fb72"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6315#issuecomment-5764869"}
