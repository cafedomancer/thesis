Sorry about that! Prefer to treat this as a cleanup & refactoring, not to advertise it as a new feature.\r\n\r\nThe comment on the unit test is good, but the test code itself doesn't communicate what's going on. Rather than defining the scope elsewhere then calling it in the test, consider defining the scope within the test. Also, asserting that no exceptions are raised is imprecise: \"nothing blows up!\" Assert that the scoping returns what you expect it to.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d3e07bd354364b90058f7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9274#issuecomment-15062268"}
