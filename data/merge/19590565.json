The change in the application.rb file was something that @jeremy originally suggested so that we could get around the fact that each application is a singleton instance of a particular ``Rails::Application`` subclass. \r\n\r\nI'm not really sure how to go about removing the subclass singleton without changing how an application is initialized in the application.rb file. I'll look into this in the next couple of days to see if I can find a more backwards compatible alternative.", "_id": {"$oid": "523cf96fbd354364b9003916"}, "issue_id": 10099, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/19590565", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10099#issuecomment-19590565", "updated_at": "2013-06-18T04:40:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn", "login": "wangjohn", "gravatar_id": "ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab", "html_url": "https://github.com/wangjohn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1075780, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-06-18T04:40:27Z", "id": 19590565, "owner": "rails"}
