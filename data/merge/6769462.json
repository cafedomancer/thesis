{"body": "@NZKoz My comments and confirmations by @emboss are for key derivation, *not* directly for password authentication.\n\n@emboss also stated about password authentication. It's also valid because password authentication is actually a key derivation; deriving authentication key (stretched password hash) from master key (password.) That said, I have no idea how Rails should use bcrypt and PBKDF2.\n\nAh, you meant that Application::Something#derive_key gets only *salt* to derive a new key because you're going to hide master key inside of Application, right?
