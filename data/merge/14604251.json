For example, see here in the documentation: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations.rb#L933. \r\n\r\nEven more clear is inside the belongs_to_association file where ``invertible_for?`` is defined: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/belongs_to_association.rb#L72-77. The code clearly only works for has_one associations, not has_many.\r\n\r\nI'm not adding any extra functionality to inverse_of, I'm simply making sure that if an inverse can be found easily, then Rails will automatically call that inverse instead of waiting for the user to add it.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1ea1bd354364b9004dc8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9522#issuecomment-14604251"}
