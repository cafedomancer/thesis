For example, see here in the documentation: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations.rb#L933. \r\n\r\nEven more clear is inside the belongs_to_association file where ``invertible_for?`` is defined: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/belongs_to_association.rb#L72-77. The code clearly only works for has_one associations, not has_many.\r\n\r\nI'm not adding any extra functionality to inverse_of, I'm simply making sure that if an inverse can be found easily, then Rails will automatically call that inverse instead of waiting for the user to add it.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1ea1bd354364b9004dc8"}, "issue_id": 9522, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14604251", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9522#issuecomment-14604251", "updated_at": "2013-03-08T06:16:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn", "login": "wangjohn", "gravatar_id": "ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab", "html_url": "https://github.com/wangjohn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1075780, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-08T06:04:47Z", "id": 14604251, "owner": "rails"}
