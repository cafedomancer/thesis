{"body": "> If the PR had been named \"allow to_date to accept invalid dates\", I imagine there would have been a little more discussion around it, and maybe a better plan for the migration.\r\n\r\nI think that's harsh - more accurate to say 'allow to_date to accept additional invalid dates' since `to_date` allows invalid dates in 3.2.x, e.g:\r\n\r\n``` irb\r\n$ rails c\r\nLoading development environment (Rails 3.2.13)\r\n>> '2000-07-01INVALID'.to_date\r\n=> Sat, 01 Jul 2000\r\n```\r\n\r\n>  I can't find any discussions of people being unhappy with the old parsing behavior, and it's been that way for a while so I think it's safe to say that the rails community was basically fine with the old behavior.\r\n\r\n[\"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\"][1]\r\n\r\nJust because you can't find any discussions that `to_date` parsing was too strict or incorrect doesn't mean that the Rails community was fine with it's behavior.
