I think we need to extract the rake task in to some sort of plugin system or something though.  Having this much code in a rake task is pretty ridiculous.  I imagine we need some sort of factory method that returns the correct runner for a particular database.  Then we can just test each runner independently.\r\n\r\nI'll merge this in for now though.
