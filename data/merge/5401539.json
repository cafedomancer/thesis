{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5986", "repo": "rails", "body": "@twinturbo yeah, that's my understanding, the deprecation behavior is supposed to handle only Rails related deprecations, that'll likely happen at runtime and will clutter your logs on some / most requests. Say you're using the now deprecated finders, with `:silence` you would not get deprecations anymore in your logs, for instance. Deprecations from gems, such as in their configurations, will happen only once when the gem is loaded, and I think that's fine. Gems could / should also make use of this deprecation behavior to show their deprecations in the future.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381084bd3543c15100d6aa"}, "issue_id": 5986, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5401539", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5986#issuecomment-5401539", "updated_at": "2012-04-29T00:36:00Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-29T00:36:00Z", "id": 5401539, "owner": "rails"}
