Say you're using the now deprecated finders, with `:silence` you would not get deprecations anymore in your logs, for instance. Deprecations from gems, such as in their configurations, will happen only once when the gem is loaded, and I think that's fine. Gems could / should also make use of this deprecation behavior to show their deprecations in the future.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381084bd3543c15100d6aa"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5986#issuecomment-5401539"}
