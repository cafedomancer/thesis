{"body": "This is great! Thank you!\r\n\r\nEverything is good except for two things:\r\n\r\n1. Please add `[ci skip]` to documentation commit messages. (oh wait, it looks like you have now)\r\n2. Since this will be a part of Rails 4, no need to mention 'as of Rails 4.' Documentation should always reflect the current version, if people need to know how things worked in the past, they can look at the old docs. Imagine reading a comment today that says \"As of Rails 1.2...\"\r\n\r\nPlease go ahead and fold those two changes into your existing commit!", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/23571216", "created_at": "2013-08-30T15:59:47Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12077#issuecomment-23571216", "updated_at": "2013-08-30T15:59:47Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 12077, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0c22d45f31acf0f4192c8c12b7a55dee.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "gravatar_id": "233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "steveklabnik", "type": "User", "id": 27786, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cf27bd3543c151007aff"}, "id": 23571216, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/12077"}
