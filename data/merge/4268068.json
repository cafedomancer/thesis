There is no ordering to an SQL table by default, so adding one via the Rails framework seems artificial. This could also cause performance pains, especially for heavily sharded databases. I think it would be better to allow users to customize this behavior on their own, for instance by using a scope:\r\n\r\n    scope :first_by_id, order('id ASC').first", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138cb"}, "issue_id": 5153, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4268068", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4268068", "updated_at": "2012-03-01T19:14:41Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos", "login": "panthomakos", "gravatar_id": "22a9bb6a9ec077e4d666d98052790c05", "html_url": "https://github.com/panthomakos", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/22a9bb6a9ec077e4d666d98052790c05?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd11f0caf58f8bf7c3bdedb631acfaa64.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 186424, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-01T19:14:41Z", "id": 4268068, "owner": "rails"}
