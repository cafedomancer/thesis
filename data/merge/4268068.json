{"body": "It seems to me that having an implicit order clause in `first` is more confusing than just letting the backend return whatever it's going to return. There is no ordering to an SQL table by default, so adding one via the Rails framework seems artificial. This could also cause performance pains, especially for heavily sharded databases. I think it would be better to allow users to customize this behavior on their own, for instance by using a scope:\r\n\r\n    scope :first_by_id, order('id ASC').first", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4268068", "created_at": "2012-03-01T19:14:41Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4268068", "updated_at": "2012-03-01T19:14:41Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5153, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/panthomakos", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/22a9bb6a9ec077e4d666d98052790c05?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd11f0caf58f8bf7c3bdedb631acfaa64.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/received_events", "gravatar_id": "22a9bb6a9ec077e4d666d98052790c05", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "panthomakos", "type": "User", "id": 186424, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138cb"}, "id": 4268068, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5153"}
