There is no ordering to an SQL table by default, so adding one via the Rails framework seems artificial. This could also cause performance pains, especially for heavily sharded databases. I think it would be better to allow users to customize this behavior on their own, for instance by using a scope:\r\n\r\n    scope :first_by_id, order('id ASC').first", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138cb"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4268068"}
