If they use `ActiveSupport::Deprecation.instance` the message is going to say that something will be removed from `rails` which is in many cases not what the authors of gems would like to announce to the users.\n\nThese:\n\n```ruby\ndeprecator = ActiveSupport::Deprecation.new\ndeprecator.deprecation_horizon = \"2.0.0\"\n```\n\n```ruby\nActiveSupport::Deprecation.new.tap{|d| d.deprecation_horizon = \"2.0.0\" }\n```\n\nseem to be unnecessary verbose to me.\n\n```ruby\nActiveSupport::Deprecation.new(\"2.0.0\", \"formtastic\")\n```\n\nlooks much better imho.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e6380bd354364b900f9c8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6348#issuecomment-5812964"}
