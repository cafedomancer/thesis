My software has migrations which (1) create a table (2) insert data using SQL. This breaks now when spinning up new instances because the data migration didn't insert timestamps, since null was Ok and they were not important.\r\n\r\nI disagree with Mike's original claim. Timestamps are a nice-to-have simple free audit mechanism. They are in no way required to be present for most apps to function.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5238378fbd3543c15100fe98"}, "issue_id": 3334, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16986703", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3334#issuecomment-16986703", "updated_at": "2013-04-25T03:23:07Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlanett/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlanett/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlanett/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlanett/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlanett", "login": "mlanett", "gravatar_id": "1f3ccf1f4a1a0f37fa2b81308b9d2a0d", "html_url": "https://github.com/mlanett", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlanett/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlanett/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlanett/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/1f3ccf1f4a1a0f37fa2b81308b9d2a0d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb27f2d2e64a719256f1d3b55cfbede9b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlanett/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 169624, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlanett/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-04-25T03:23:07Z", "id": 16986703, "owner": "rails"}
