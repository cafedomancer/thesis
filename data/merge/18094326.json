My question was what the benefit of that would be aside from looking more ruby-like. `append_handler` is pointless, as every object will always match `BasicObject`, so no handler after that would ever be matched. The implementation of `handles?` for every existing case would be nearly identical, and it'd end up introducing a lot of duplication.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I like the idea of having a class defined to handle this responsibility, but I feel like there's something to be said for the ability to simply pass in a class and a lambda for the simple cases. That said, I'm not opposed to the idea, assuming no performance hit. Anyone else have an opinion on the issue?", "_id": {"$oid": "523cc514bd354364b90025e4"}, "issue_id": 10673, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18094326", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10673#issuecomment-18094326", "updated_at": "2013-05-18T03:15:55Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif", "login": "sgrif", "gravatar_id": "0f674817f8c6e149518f0a4b4ad3d560", "html_url": "https://github.com/sgrif", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/0f674817f8c6e149518f0a4b4ad3d560?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7f844d9af6961157c094f8d5bbf716a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1529387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgrif/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-18T03:13:40Z", "id": 18094326, "owner": "rails"}
