My question was what the benefit of that would be aside from looking more ruby-like. `append_handler` is pointless, as every object will always match `BasicObject`, so no handler after that would ever be matched. The implementation of `handles?` for every existing case would be nearly identical, and it'd end up introducing a lot of duplication.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I like the idea of having a class defined to handle this responsibility, but I feel like there's something to be said for the ability to simply pass in a class and a lambda for the simple cases. That said, I'm not opposed to the idea, assuming no performance hit. Anyone else have an opinion on the issue?", "_id": {"$oid": "523cc514bd354364b90025e4"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10673#issuecomment-18094326"}
