{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3151", "repo": "rails", "body": "I agree that it does not look good.  I was guided by a desire to play nice with existing usages.\r\n\r\nIt seems silly to me to have this `pluralize` method without including an option to omit the count.  Sure, it's easy to implement in one's apps, but it's even easier if this functionality exists in the framework.  A Google search for \"[rails pluralize without count](http://www.google.com/search?e=UTF-8&q=rails+pluralize+without+count)\" reveals that this is a common annoyance.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to not have multiple `*pluralize` methods, so option 1 seems to be best way to go.  Within option 1 there are 2 options:\r\n\r\n1. Support 2 method signatures: `pluralize(count, singular, plural_form = nil)` and `pluralize(count, singular, options = {})`, where `plural_form` is expected to be a `String` and `options` is expected to be a `Hash` with optional parameters `:plural_form` (default nil) and `:include_count` (default true).\r\n\r\n2. Support only `pluralize(count, singular, options = {})`.  This would break existing usages, which would be a bad thing.  But not overloading methods where not strictly necessary is nice.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383a17bd3543c151010167"}, "issue_id": 3151, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2216919", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3151#issuecomment-2216919", "updated_at": "2011-09-27T21:49:45Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak", "login": "rroblak", "gravatar_id": "16f606d6f3cd4f7b742ec0d6db1674bf", "html_url": "https://github.com/rroblak", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/16f606d6f3cd4f7b742ec0d6db1674bf?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4df49b56bc16bcda30bb2dac13bce603.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 103835, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-09-27T21:49:45Z", "id": 2216919, "owner": "rails"}
