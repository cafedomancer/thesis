I was guided by a desire to play nice with existing usages.\r\n\r\nIt seems silly to me to have this `pluralize` method without including an option to omit the count.  Sure, it's easy to implement in one's apps, but it's even easier if this functionality exists in the framework.  A Google search for \"[rails pluralize without count](http://www.google.com/search?e=UTF-8&q=rails+pluralize+without+count)\" reveals that this is a common annoyance.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to not have multiple `*pluralize` methods, so option 1 seems to be best way to go.  Within option 1 there are 2 options:\r\n\r\n1. Support 2 method signatures: `pluralize(count, singular, plural_form = nil)` and `pluralize(count, singular, options = {})`, where `plural_form` is expected to be a `String` and `options` is expected to be a `Hash` with optional parameters `:plural_form` (default nil) and `:include_count` (default true).\r\n\r\n2. Support only `pluralize(count, singular, options = {})`.  This would break existing usages, which would be a bad thing.  But not overloading methods where not strictly necessary is nice.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383a17bd3543c151010167"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3151#issuecomment-2216919"}
