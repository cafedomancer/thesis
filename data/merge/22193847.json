Also don't check the returned `digest` for presence and cache it anyway.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d15ebd3543c151007dc4"}, "issue_id": 11768, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/22193847", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11768#issuecomment-22193847", "updated_at": "2013-08-06T16:55:58Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone", "login": "thedarkone", "gravatar_id": "c203190318ed9534390c93d1744a6cf1", "html_url": "https://github.com/thedarkone", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/c203190318ed9534390c93d1744a6cf1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F68e4593563e1b425a7717504bca103d6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 15688, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-08-06T16:55:58Z", "id": 22193847, "owner": "rails"}
