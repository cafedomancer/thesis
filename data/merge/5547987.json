I guess this will want to be brought through to the 3-2-stable banch too given the backport in #6170.\r\n\r\nHope I've done the correct thing in pushing this to docrails; if not, let me know and I'll revert and open pull requests instead.\r\n\r\nCheers.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380d26bd3543c15100d27a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6156#issuecomment-5547987"}
