{"body": "Nice! I would love to write controller specs with mocking #save without having to mock .find:\n\n<pre>\nsite = Factory :site\nsite.should_receive(:update_attributes).with('foo' => 'bar').and_return(true)\nput :update, :id => site.to_param, :site => { :foo => \"bar\" }\nresponse.should redirect_to(site_url(site))\n</pre>\n\nThis actually works now!\n\nAnyway, I've tried it on two real live Rails 3.0 apps and put them on rails master and miloops identimap_branch.\n\nThe first app showed no difference in performance. It has 332 examples, all 3 versions took around 20 seconds to run and around 118MB of RAM used. In the identity_map branch there was one failing spec.\n\nA second project (544 specs) did show some differences between Rails 3.0 and the master branch, but no difference in performance in the identity_map branch. But there were a lot of failing specs though.\n\n3.0 stable: 35 seconds, 272MB, 0 failing specs\nmaster: 29 seconds, 260MB, 2 failing specs\nidentity_map: 29 seconds 260MB, 13 failing specs\n\nThese weren't real benchmarks or anything, I just ran `rake spec` and observed memory usage myself.\nThe failing specs were all different errors, but all related to updating and finding records.\n\nOh, I couldn't get cucumber to run on master or identity_map, which is a shame, because that would've been more representative of real usage.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/457333", "created_at": "2010-10-08T22:40:02Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/76#issuecomment-457333", "updated_at": "2010-10-08T22:42:27Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 76, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iain/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iain/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iain/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/iain", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iain/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/iain", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iain/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/42ec9fd08c179b547dcb60d977e29941?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd8a3b2dde3181c8257e2e45efbd1e8ae.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iain/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iain/received_events", "gravatar_id": "42ec9fd08c179b547dcb60d977e29941", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iain/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "iain", "type": "User", "id": 12692, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iain/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386bbabd3543c151012c18"}, "id": 457333, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/76"}
