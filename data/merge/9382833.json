Those two are the ones that justify having `ActiveSupport::Cache::Entry` objects serialized.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the discussion was that we want to support them, and @bdurand provided a patch that made serialized entry objects much lighter. If someone wants to store raw values in a different cache store implementation at the cost of losing those features, he can do it in a plugin.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to bring those 5 minutes back.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7bcbd3543c15100b10e"}, "issue_id": 7913, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9382833", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7913#issuecomment-9382833", "updated_at": "2012-10-12T16:51:09Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-12T16:50:18Z", "id": 9382833, "owner": "rails"}
