For example in the following case `save!` should have blown up. But it does not in master.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n\r\n  has_many :todos\r\n\r\n  def self.lab\r\n    User.delete_all\r\n    Todo.delete_all\r\n    user = User.create!\r\n    user.todos.create(title: 'clean house')\r\n\r\n    user = User.joins(:todos).select(\"users.*, todos.title as todos_title\").first\r\n\r\n    puts user.readonly? #> false\r\n    user.todos_title = 'clean pet'\r\n    user.save! # no error but the title is not changed in the db\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinding out all the cases were `implicit_readonly` should be applied is a bit tricky. So it is best if it is left to the user.\r\n\r\n@senny while you are at it,  please also cleanup usage of `implicit_readonly` also from `relation.rb` file.\r\n\r\nAdd something like this to change log\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage of `implicit_readonly` is being removed`. Please use `readonly` method \r\nexplicitly to mark records as `readonly.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nuser = User.joins(:todos).select(\"users.*, todos.title as todos_title\").readonly(true).first\r\nuser.todos_title = 'clean pet'\r\nuser.save! # will raise error\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm +1 on this PR.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dbd1bd3543c151008905"}, "issue_id": 10769, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18509225", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10769#issuecomment-18509225", "updated_at": "2013-05-27T18:01:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname", "login": "neerajdotname", "gravatar_id": "934f858e451cf9b771996b2940cd696b", "html_url": "https://github.com/neerajdotname", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/934f858e451cf9b771996b2940cd696b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F985e9a46e10005356bbaf194249f6856.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6399, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/neerajdotname/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-27T18:01:12Z", "id": 18509225, "owner": "rails"}
