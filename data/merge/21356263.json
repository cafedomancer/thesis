{"body": "On security: right now serving this page in production gives away that we are running rails (though default error pages also do) and it may hint as to the version of rails since you could do a diff of the page versus known default rails index pages. Any of the app specific info is behind other urls that are not available in production.\r\n\r\nThe original intent of moving away from static `index.html` is to avoid confusion for new comers who will add a root but don't know you need to also delete a file to make that work. And for seasoned devs it removes one step from a \"typical\" rails app.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it took away the quick `rails new ; deploy` check some people and quite a few tutorials are using.\r\n\r\nAn optimal solution will minimize confusion around deleting any pages, provide getting started information for new developers on first `rails new`, and minimize differences between dev and prod behavior. All of this without exposing any sensitive data. This PR was my attempt at addressing all of those points, I'm still open to alternative implementations. What are some other options for achieving all of these goals? \r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/21356263", "created_at": "2013-07-22T16:23:32Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11514#issuecomment-21356263", "updated_at": "2013-07-22T16:23:32Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 11514, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/schneems", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ef42a6eab211ddd71ac423a80b42d15.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/received_events", "gravatar_id": "db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "schneems", "type": "User", "id": 59744, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d3a8bd3543c151007fcc"}, "id": 21356263, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11514"}
