Let me know if there's anything I need to do to format this.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, if I find two or three documentation issues in the same file should I submit that as a single pull request with multiple commits, a single large commit, or completely separate pull requests? If there's a guideline for when to use docrails and when to use a PR into rails main that would work too.\r\n\r\n~Earl", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cf27bd3543c151007b01"}, "issue_id": 12077, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/23600334", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12077#issuecomment-23600334", "updated_at": "2013-08-31T04:21:45Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estsauver/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estsauver/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estsauver/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estsauver/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/estsauver", "login": "estsauver", "gravatar_id": "24be6b5d6e90fdcd931f4dd65c414385", "html_url": "https://github.com/estsauver", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estsauver/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estsauver/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estsauver/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/24be6b5d6e90fdcd931f4dd65c414385?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F51b702ab733f14ab39bc405642fbe7ab.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estsauver/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 766985, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/estsauver/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-08-31T04:21:45Z", "id": 23600334, "owner": "rails"}
