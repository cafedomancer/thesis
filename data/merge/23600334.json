Let me know if there's anything I need to do to format this.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, if I find two or three documentation issues in the same file should I submit that as a single pull request with multiple commits, a single large commit, or completely separate pull requests? If there's a guideline for when to use docrails and when to use a PR into rails main that would work too.\r\n\r\n~Earl", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cf27bd3543c151007b01"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12077#issuecomment-23600334"}
