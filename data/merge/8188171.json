I had trouble running bundler (due to use of new hash syntax in rails/Gemfile)...", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fb92bd3543c15100b819"}, "issue_id": 7439, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8188171", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7439#issuecomment-8188171", "updated_at": "2012-08-31T10:37:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/refractalize/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/refractalize/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/refractalize/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/refractalize/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/refractalize", "login": "refractalize", "gravatar_id": "53d301869ff9f450d180eb40fdcca434", "html_url": "https://github.com/refractalize", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/refractalize/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/refractalize/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/refractalize/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53d301869ff9f450d180eb40fdcca434?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9e8bddf5b34fc59a3c48d6f0e1d8875b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/refractalize/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 123917, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/refractalize/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-31T10:37:20Z", "id": 8188171, "owner": "rails"}
