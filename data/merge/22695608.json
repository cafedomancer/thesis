Currently there are 5 and the history looks kinda messed up. I think the easiest thing now is to create a new branch from `master` apply the patch diff, and push that branch to this Pull Request. You should be able to achieve this with something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit checkout -b search_less_on_rake_notes master\r\ngit diff master... add_less_to_rake_todos | git apply\r\ngit add -A\r\ngit commit -m \"Adding LESS to rake notes\"\r\ngit push -uf origin search_less_on_rake_notes:add_less_to_rake_todos\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d065bd3543c151007ca6"}, "issue_id": 11900, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/22695608", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11900#issuecomment-22695608", "updated_at": "2013-08-15T10:28:17Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "login": "senny", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-08-15T10:28:17Z", "id": 22695608, "owner": "rails"}
