Currently there are 5 and the history looks kinda messed up. I think the easiest thing now is to create a new branch from `master` apply the patch diff, and push that branch to this Pull Request. You should be able to achieve this with something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit checkout -b search_less_on_rake_notes master\r\ngit diff master... add_less_to_rake_todos | git apply\r\ngit add -A\r\ngit commit -m \"Adding LESS to rake notes\"\r\ngit push -uf origin search_less_on_rake_notes:add_less_to_rake_todos\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d065bd3543c151007ca6"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11900#issuecomment-22695608"}
