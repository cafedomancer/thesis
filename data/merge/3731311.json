{"body": "This seems to break code where an inheritance tree defines both a table_name_prefix and defines a sequence pattern for all models inheriting from this tree.\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass A < B\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass B < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  self.abstract_class = true\r\n  self.table_name_prefix = 'core.'\r\n  self.sequence_name = :autogenerated\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe queries will work correctly, but because of the behavior of base_class, when the connection asks for the sequence_name, base_class returns A and not B.  A then resets the sequence_name and it is no longer pulled from the super, instead, you get a sequence name 'core.a_seq'\r\n\r\nSeems we are missing a test case where the sequence_name is set in the base class and is retained in the subclass.\r\n\r\nAre there any suggestions for work arounds?
