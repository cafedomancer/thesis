{"body": "Recommend getting rid of PoolFullError and making them all ConnectionTimeoutError. \n\nI think PoolFullError is a relic of @tenderlove's initial inclination to get rid of signal/wait entirely, and at that point got rid of ConnectionTimeout error entirely in favor of PoolFull.  \n\nIf it's back, and with an actual robust working implementaiton (awesome job @pmahoney), I think they should be consolidated back to ConnectionTimeoutError -- there's no reason I can see for the distinction, currently the different circumstances in which one will be called instead of the other are circumstances the actual client calling `#checkout` has no way or need of knowing about, they're purely internal.
