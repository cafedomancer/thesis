If first and last are related methods (and I'd think that based on the names alone 99.9% of used would say they were), the a change to first() would seem tidy.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think the issue is first(). Maybe, in an ideal world, you'd rename first to be \"one\" or \"row\" and take a year to deprecate first, but I'm not convinced.\r\n\r\nHowever, I _do_ think it would be very worthwhile to add a warning to an ARel chain that uses offset() but not order(), because the use of offset() really does imply that you want deterministic order.", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138d3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4643816"}
