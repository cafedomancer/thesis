{"body": "> How do we deprecate this behavior and remain backwards compatible?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this has ever been a Rails priority :), \r\n\r\n> Primary key doesn't necessarily indicate which record was the first to be added. \r\n\r\nI agree, but the last() method already assumes that ordering is based on id(). If first and last are related methods (and I'd think that based on the names alone 99.9% of used would say they were), the a change to first() would seem tidy.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think the issue is first(). Maybe, in an ideal world, you'd rename first to be \"one\" or \"row\" and take a year to deprecate first, but I'm not convinced.\r\n\r\nHowever, I _do_ think it would be very worthwhile to add a warning to an ARel chain that uses offset() but not order(), because the use of offset() really does imply that you want deterministic order.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4643816", "created_at": "2012-03-22T17:26:08Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4643816", "updated_at": "2012-03-22T17:26:39Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5153, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pragdave/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pragdave/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pragdave/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pragdave", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pragdave/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/pragdave", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pragdave/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d06917e13b29bcff1c1609492c06873?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb59f635e9f984164bf71aa36a8dd265e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pragdave/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pragdave/received_events", "gravatar_id": "5d06917e13b29bcff1c1609492c06873", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pragdave/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "pragdave", "type": "User", "id": 10648, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pragdave/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138d3"}, "id": 4643816, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5153"}
