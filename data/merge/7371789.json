Many people today have their `default_locale` set to something other than english while keeping their whole application in english. Also `I18n.default_locale` (and I18n as a whole) focuses mainly on view behavior, having it drastically affect how an application works internally is a bad idea. We could have another option for that, but I would rather see the need before adding it.\n\n2) Well, I believe some people use titleize for such purpose but let's go with what I just said above: let's see the need before adding it. About different pluralization and singularization rules, I18n already tackles it. I don't think it is in scope with Rails (given their complexity)\n\n3) Great.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e029fbd354364b900c60f"}, "issue_id": 7197, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7371789", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7197#issuecomment-7371789", "updated_at": "2012-07-30T15:33:39Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-30T15:33:39Z", "id": 7371789, "owner": "rails"}
