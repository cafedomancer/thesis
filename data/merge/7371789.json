{"body": "1) Except it isn't backwards compatible. Many people today have their `default_locale` set to something other than english while keeping their whole application in english. Also `I18n.default_locale` (and I18n as a whole) focuses mainly on view behavior, having it drastically affect how an application works internally is a bad idea.
