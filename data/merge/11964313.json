It looks like a simple case for me, I have no idea why git can't merge it automatically. I tried to change it but still get the same error. The only thing I can suggest you is to merge the branch by hands.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d84c4bd354364b9007739"}, "issue_id": 8527, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11964313", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8527#issuecomment-11964313", "updated_at": "2013-01-07T18:38:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shockone/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shockone/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shockone/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shockone/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/shockone", "login": "shockone", "gravatar_id": "20b6441a990cf524f4ce73f67f3a56d8", "html_url": "https://github.com/shockone", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shockone/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shockone/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shockone/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/20b6441a990cf524f4ce73f67f3a56d8?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F5b8fb84a844a593b9eb6f95761e30703.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shockone/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 188928, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shockone/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-07T18:38:27Z", "id": 11964313, "owner": "rails"}
