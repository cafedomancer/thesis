Rails 3-2-stable added the possibility of passing :formats along with `render` where previously you had to pass `render :template => \"foo.html\"`. `.html` was handled inside the resolver which didn't allow the format to leak but could cause weird results (like the formats being :xml and you rendering a :html file). I think current behavior and logic is better. :)", "_id": {"$oid": "523ebdbfbd354364b90126cd"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5480#issuecomment-4553895"}
