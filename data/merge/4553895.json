{"body": "Yes, let's just move the logic to `_render_template` and it looks perfect now. :+1: for merging it on 3-2-stable and master.\r\n\r\nOverall, I actually don't think this looks weird. Rails 3-2-stable added the possibility of passing :formats along with `render` where previously you had to pass `render :template => \"foo.html\"`. `.html` was handled inside the resolver which didn't allow the format to leak but could cause weird results (like the formats being :xml and you rendering a :html file). I think current behavior and logic is better. :)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4553895", "created_at": "2012-03-17T13:11:28Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5480#issuecomment-4553895", "updated_at": "2012-03-17T13:11:28Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5480, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ebdbfbd354364b90126cd"}, "id": 4553895, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5480"}
