{"body": "1. If we're exposing this for reuse, we need docs! How should a library author use this?\n2. Feels like libraries using separate deprecators should be working with instances of a class rather than extending with a module that injects a bunch of behavior, including its internal state. Could make `ActiveSupport::Deprecation` a class (without breaking API) and delegate the existing toplevel methods to a singleton `ActiveSupport::Deprecation.instance`\n3. The `#deprecator` instance method may be unnecessary. Looks like the only reason we need it is so the deprecated method wrapper can refer to it. It'd be cleaner to pass a deprecator instance and reference it directly from the method wrapper (using `define_method` instead of `class_eval`)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5741834", "created_at": "2012-05-16T14:11:55Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6348#issuecomment-5741834", "updated_at": "2012-05-16T14:11:55Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6348, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremy", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84d9ee44e457ddef7f2c4f25dc8fa865.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/received_events", "gravatar_id": "24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jeremy", "type": "User", "id": 199, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e6380bd354364b900f9c4"}, "id": 5741834, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6348"}
