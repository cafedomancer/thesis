{"body": "Cheers. Getting some unit tests together for this now and I'm having a bit of trouble. I've put the test for mysql_adapter.rb in `activerecord/test/cases/adapters/mysql/mysql_adapter_test.rb` as follows:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\n      def test_mysql_in_strict_mode\r\n        result = @connection.exec_query \"SELECT @@SESSION.sql_mode\"\r\n        assert_equal [[\"STRICT_ALL_TABLES\"]], result.rows\r\n      end\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I can't figure out where to put it for mysql2_adapter. Furthermore, there looks to be functionality in mysql2_adapter (eg, setting the encoding) that is untested.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5410627", "created_at": "2012-04-30T01:28:11Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6069#issuecomment-5410627", "updated_at": "2012-04-30T01:28:11Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6069, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mipearson/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mipearson/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mipearson/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mipearson", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mipearson/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/mipearson", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mipearson/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/4c72c888bea79af1f4d39c3eadef77d7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F800815b9811cd587b6071a5f542b7218.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mipearson/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mipearson/received_events", "gravatar_id": "4c72c888bea79af1f4d39c3eadef77d7", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mipearson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "mipearson", "type": "User", "id": 97317, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mipearson/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e89dabd354364b9010a6d"}, "id": 5410627, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6069"}
