Getting some unit tests together for this now and I'm having a bit of trouble. I've put the test for mysql_adapter.rb in `activerecord/test/cases/adapters/mysql/mysql_adapter_test.rb` as follows:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\n      def test_mysql_in_strict_mode\r\n        result = @connection.exec_query \"SELECT @@SESSION.sql_mode\"\r\n        assert_equal [[\"STRICT_ALL_TABLES\"]], result.rows\r\n      end\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I can't figure out where to put it for mysql2_adapter. Furthermore, there looks to be functionality in mysql2_adapter (eg, setting the encoding) that is untested.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e89dabd354364b9010a6d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6069#issuecomment-5410627"}
