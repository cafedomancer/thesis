In fact I think the issue has more to do with the behavior of `last` than it does with `first`. I think a possible solution could be:\r\n\r\n1. Add a warning if `first` or `last` are called without an order.\r\n2. Remove the ordering from `last`.\r\n\r\nThat way the behavior is consistent without having to deal with primary key ordering. This also removes the assumption that `first` == \"the first record that was inserted\" which is not something that adding an ordering will solve (as @tenderlove points out PK is not an indicator of this).", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138d4"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4644041"}
