{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5153", "repo": "rails", "body": "I agree with @tenderlove on this issue. In fact I think the issue has more to do with the behavior of `last` than it does with `first`. I think a possible solution could be:\r\n\r\n1. Add a warning if `first` or `last` are called without an order.\r\n2. Remove the ordering from `last`.\r\n\r\nThat way the behavior is consistent without having to deal with primary key ordering. This also removes the assumption that `first` == \"the first record that was inserted\" which is not something that adding an ordering will solve (as @tenderlove points out PK is not an indicator of this).", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138d4"}, "issue_id": 5153, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4644041", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4644041", "updated_at": "2012-03-22T17:37:14Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos", "login": "panthomakos", "gravatar_id": "22a9bb6a9ec077e4d666d98052790c05", "html_url": "https://github.com/panthomakos", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/22a9bb6a9ec077e4d666d98052790c05?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd11f0caf58f8bf7c3bdedb631acfaa64.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 186424, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-22T17:37:14Z", "id": 4644041, "owner": "rails"}
