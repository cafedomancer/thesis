{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7521", "repo": "rails", "body": "Just a warning: this pull request is mostly incomplete and can be misleading. If an user uses the rake task to retrieve the charset, Active Record is still going to use `config/database.yml` (via `ActiveRecord::Base.configurations`) to lookup the DB information, completely ignoring DATABASE_URL. This happens because this patch chose to attack some particular areas and explicitly check for `ENV[\"DATABASE_URL\"]`, while the ideal solution is to ensure the DATABASE_URL configuration ends up at `ActiveRecord::Base.configurations`. Ideally, there should be only one place where DATABASE_URL is mentioned, everything else should work transparently.", "_id": {"$oid": "523de53bbd354364b900b1ee"}, "issue_id": 7521, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14335626", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7521#issuecomment-14335626", "updated_at": "2013-03-02T20:59:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-02T20:59:27Z", "id": 14335626, "owner": "rails"}
