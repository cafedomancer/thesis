If an user uses the rake task to retrieve the charset, Active Record is still going to use `config/database.yml` (via `ActiveRecord::Base.configurations`) to lookup the DB information, completely ignoring DATABASE_URL. This happens because this patch chose to attack some particular areas and explicitly check for `ENV[\"DATABASE_URL\"]`, while the ideal solution is to ensure the DATABASE_URL configuration ends up at `ActiveRecord::Base.configurations`. Ideally, there should be only one place where DATABASE_URL is mentioned, everything else should work transparently.", "_id": {"$oid": "523de53bbd354364b900b1ee"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7521#issuecomment-14335626"}
