{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8722", "repo": "rails", "body": "It appears that this patch was created to solve an issue related to an error message.   It happens to have a side effect of changing active record's date parsing.   \r\n\r\nThis change to date parsing is not mentioned in the guide and I can't find any reference to it on the mailing list.   Your opinion is that this unintended side effect is beneficial.   My opinion is this side effect will end up making rails developers lives more difficult unnecessarily.  \r\n\r\nIf the PR had been named \"allow to_date to accept invalid dates\", I imagine there would have been a little more discussion around it, and maybe a better plan for the migration.  \r\n\r\nAt the very least we could do what rails does in other instances - issuing deprecation warnings, creating a gem that gives old behavior, pointing it out in the guide etc...   These kinds of unpleasant surprises can costs people thousands of dollars to fix, and I think it will catch most developers by surprise. \r\n\r\nAs far as the behavior itself, Rails improves on ruby core methods all the time.  I can't find any discussions of people being unhappy with the old parsing behavior, and it's been that way for a while so I think it's safe to say that the rails community was basically fine with the old behavior.  \r\n\r\nOn Aug 2, 2013, at 6:36 AM, Andrew White <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> To quote the Ruby docs on Date::parse:\r\n> \r\n> This method does not function as a validator.\r\n> \r\n> The only reason it raised an error before is because the previous code assumed the presence of year, month and day values and passed nil for the latter two constructor arguments - Date::_parse still parses '333333INVALID' as a valid date. It's not advisable to rely on the internal implementation String#to_date to validate your dates for you.\r\n> \r\n> \u2014\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d74d7bd354364b9006eaf"}, "issue_id": 8722, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/22023339", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8722#issuecomment-22023339", "updated_at": "2013-08-02T18:11:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zilkey/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zilkey/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zilkey/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zilkey/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/zilkey", "login": "zilkey", "gravatar_id": "c84807bb5457755ec17ba32ff713a9b2", "html_url": "https://github.com/zilkey", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zilkey/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zilkey/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zilkey/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/c84807bb5457755ec17ba32ff713a9b2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2dbf21633f03afcf882eaf10e4b5caca.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zilkey/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2451, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zilkey/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-08-02T18:11:15Z", "id": 22023339, "owner": "rails"}
