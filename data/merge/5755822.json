I've made the following improvements:\n\nI've moved the output safety concerns back to NumberHelper, fixed the class method protection and updated the ActiveSupport guide.\n\nThe methods now are versions of to_s:\n```ruby\n1235551234.to_s(:phone)                              # => 123-555-1234\n1234567890.50.to_s(:currency)                        # => $1,234,567,890.50\n100.to_s(:percentage)                                # => 100.000%\n12345678.to_s(:delimited)                            # => 12,345,678\n111.2345.to_s(:rounded)                              # => 111.235\n123.to_s(:human_size)                                # => 123 Bytes\n1234567890123456.to_s(:human)                        # => \"1.23 Quadrillion\"\n```\n\nThe class versions are still around, because I could not find a good way to get rid of them.  I have changed the names of the \"with_\" methods, to have more consistency:\n\n```ruby\nNumeric.to_phone(5551234)                            # => 555-1234\nNumeric.to_currency(1234567890.50)                   # => $1,234,567,890.50\nNumeric.to_percentage(100)                           # => 100.000%\nNumeric.to_delimited(12345678)                       # => 12,345,678\nNumeric.to_rounded(111.2345)                         # => 111.235\nNumeric.to_human_size(123)                           # => 123 Bytes\nNumeric.to_human(123)                                # => \"123\"\n```\n\nRegarding the I18n concerns, I've added the AS en.yml file to the I18n load_path when it's not already there.  As a result, you can load just formatting.rb alone and it should function properly.\n\nThanks again for all the feedback!  Let me know if there's any more changes desired and I can make them.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523e6611bd354364b900fb6f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6315#issuecomment-5755822"}
