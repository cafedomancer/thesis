The former allows for much more idiomatic separation of code, reducing the amount of noise we have to read through in order to parse the basics, and points us to a specific location to find out more should we so choose.\n\nIt's less about simplifying the writing of the code (though some would argue that anything that allows us to break things into a separate object if we so want will be a win) and more about a further \"improvement\" to readability, if we're going to go down this route.
