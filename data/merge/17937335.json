In these cases, using an alternative JSON processor is necessary.  While those libraries certainly can be used directly, this change will break existing uses of ActiveSupport's JSON processing that have worked fine since the 2.x days.  If swapping out JSON processors isn't going to be possible, there should probably be a caveat in the upgrade guide that this could break existing apps.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dd7ebd3543c151008afe"}, "issue_id": 10576, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17937335", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10576#issuecomment-17937335", "updated_at": "2013-05-15T13:12:25Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum", "login": "nirvdrum", "gravatar_id": "0f2cc1aefa9529ba8627270cf81d2160", "html_url": "https://github.com/nirvdrum", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/0f2cc1aefa9529ba8627270cf81d2160?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F5cba6e74e996a4b1d7534b6bdc8ee5f6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 12584, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nirvdrum/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-15T13:12:25Z", "id": 17937335, "owner": "rails"}
