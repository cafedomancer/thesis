{"body": "Not to speak for @teamon, but I think the problem is there are JSON documents that the json library cannot or will not parse.  In these cases, using an alternative JSON processor is necessary.  While those libraries certainly can be used directly, this change will break existing uses of ActiveSupport's JSON processing that have worked fine since the 2.x days.
