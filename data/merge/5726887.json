Yes, we want to support translating a string that is numberish into a phone number, but for most strings these methods wont be relevant.  It would surprise me if I looked at the methods for \"banana\" and found a \"to_phone\" method.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523e6611bd354364b900fb6c"}, "issue_id": 6315, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5726887", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6315#issuecomment-5726887", "updated_at": "2012-05-15T20:45:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz", "login": "amutz", "gravatar_id": "aed424af11b9f92cca6c051f75f013b7", "html_url": "https://github.com/amutz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/aed424af11b9f92cca6c051f75f013b7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F77d85e54bebbad4c976bf8fc0923c567.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 919763, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-15T20:45:23Z", "id": 5726887, "owner": "rails"}
