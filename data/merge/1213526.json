There'll\nbe some additional mutex contention but ... it'll actually be\nthreadsafe which would be nice ;)\n\nPerhaps rework your branch to make it work that way (and remove the\nmutex from any of the internal methods) and we can see what the impact\nis?\n\nOn Thu, May 19, 2011 at 11:32 PM, xli\n<reply@reply.github.com>\nwrote:\n> The unit test added is for proving the problem, and proving the fix.
