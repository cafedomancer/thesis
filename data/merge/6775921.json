I should've read the title, too, not only the conversation ;) But as @nahi said, the same advice for PBKDF2 still holds for key derivation except for the comparison part because you no longer need to compare things.\n\nA couple of questions about the master key. How is it derived? Is it some form of external input (a password?) or would it be generated within the application itself?\n\nSo that I get it right this time: you want to\n\n1. Create a master key\n2. Derive \"session keys\" deterministically from that master key in order to encrypt cookies or other things when needed?\n\nIf so, how are you planning to do deterministic derivation? That is, based on what information would you derive the key for let's say cookie encryption?", "_id": {"$oid": "52380195bd3543c15100c173"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6952#issuecomment-6775921"}
