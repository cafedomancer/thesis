They often do a good job on \"edge cases\", but miss simple, real world usage.  As the maintainer of a book on Rails, it is in my vested interest to make sure that the scenario documented in my book actually works.  At times there are intentional changes made to Rails that cause me to need to update the book.  At other times, there are unintentional changes which break basic functionality.\r\n\r\nIf needed, I can provide a snapshot of a simple application that demonstrates the problem.  Or I can attempt to reduce the test case.", "_id": {"$oid": "523db326bd354364b90093ef"}, "issue_id": 8017, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10214402", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8017#issuecomment-10214402", "updated_at": "2012-11-09T03:20:25Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys", "login": "rubys", "gravatar_id": "e2dda5e47fccc5ff0daa87debf48162b", "html_url": "https://github.com/rubys", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e2dda5e47fccc5ff0daa87debf48162b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fed519c02f134f2cdd836cba387b6a3c8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4815, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rubys/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-09T03:20:25Z", "id": 10214402, "owner": "rails"}
