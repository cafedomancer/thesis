{"body": "1) Okay, makes sense. I've made it default to `:en` as such.\n\n2) Sounds good.\n\n3) I went ahead and changed the commented block to rules for Spanish. It makes the comment a bit long, but I thought this would be the most useful option. It specifies how to define rules for another locale while also providing (what I believe to be) a good list of rules for Spanish, which would arguably be the most-used second locale. If you think the comment's too long, however, I can change it to one of the other options I mentioned.\n\n4) Figured I'd ask because the contribution guides don't really mention it: should I also update the internationalization guide? I can also update ActiveSupport's CHANGELOG in this commit and 4.0 release notes, but I don't know if that's typically handled by Rails Core.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7373300", "created_at": "2012-07-30T16:24:10Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7197#issuecomment-7373300", "updated_at": "2012-07-30T16:55:04Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7197, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidcelis", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3e1a626a9e0c39eb548886c253bf9644.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "davidcelis", "type": "User", "id": 36873, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e029fbd354364b900c610"}, "id": 7373300, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7197"}
