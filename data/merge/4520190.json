{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/572", "repo": "rails", "body": "I'm using ActiveResource extensively on several internal projects communicating with each other and I think this is a *good thing*.  This won't kill ActiveResource, this will give it the ability to get some fixes faster than would otherwise be possible tied to a Rails release cycle.  I'm writing an internal gem that has to work from Rails 2.3.11 -> 3.2, and having to maintain compatibility with a few different AR versions is painful.  This doesn't directly solve that problem, but it sets the stage so that projects on Rails 4.0, 4.1, 5.0 and beyond can decide to upgrade AR without upgrading all of Rails.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52385e09bd3543c15101201d"}, "issue_id": 572, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4520190", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/572#issuecomment-4520190", "updated_at": "2012-03-15T14:08:50Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bokmann/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bokmann/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bokmann/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bokmann/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bokmann", "login": "bokmann", "gravatar_id": "83a9ea91315fa15a082e280761dcef28", "html_url": "https://github.com/bokmann", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bokmann/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bokmann/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bokmann/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/83a9ea91315fa15a082e280761dcef28?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fcbdbd173d97fabe53722b6edef0d0fdd.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bokmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 57926, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bokmann/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-15T14:08:50Z", "id": 4520190, "owner": "rails"}
