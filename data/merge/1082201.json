{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/343", "repo": "rails", "body": "There is definitely a need to address this problem but I'm hesitant about this particular patch because it introduces locale specific logic into ActionView.  I think this is one small part of a larger problem.  Rails is pretty good at deriving String representations of \"locale-y\" classes like Time but very bad at getting a \"locale-y\" class like Time from a String representation.  A better solution may be to extend ActiveSupport to better handle parsing of Strings back into Time given the current (or specified) locale.  From that point ActionView's date/time helpers could be reworked to use something more generic like ActiveRecord::Coders, multiparameter assignment, composed_of, or something like that.  This way the locale processing logic can stay in ActiveSupport where (IMO) it belongs.  This is just my two cents - I have absolutely zero say or influence about the direction of Rails.  :-)  I do applaud any attempt to fix this long standing problem.  Something needs to be done.  I'm curious what other people think.", "_id": {"$oid": "523861d9bd3543c151012372"}, "issue_id": 343, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1082201", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/343#issuecomment-1082201", "updated_at": "2011-05-01T01:45:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs", "login": "MDaubs", "gravatar_id": "e9b949c8749222225501c99e8e8ad9ff", "html_url": "https://github.com/MDaubs", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e9b949c8749222225501c99e8e8ad9ff?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa71c1d3324103addc6c422fa5e374d6f.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 127900, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-01T01:41:51Z", "id": 1082201, "owner": "rails"}
