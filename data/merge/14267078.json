Look, I don't really care if the URL ends up with \".json\" or not. The main reason I started to be concerned about the format is that I realized that when Rails caches some action it doesn't store the response content-type in the cache. So, the first time the action would respond with content-type 'application/json' but next time it would be 'text/html' if I remember correctly. Then I have been told that the cached action will use the content-type based on the format of the request, so I can't use \"format: false\". And the reason why I want to enforce the format is so that I don't forget about it in my client-side applications when calling some action with jQuery.getJSON (which won't run the callback if the wrong content-type is served). Sorry if this is confusing but I couldn't find any way to simplify that... That's why I ended up grouping all my JSON requests (99.9% of all requests) in a scoped block that would set format to true and the format constraint to /json/ to minimize any maintenance pain from my side...", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e8fdbd3543c1510097bc"}, "issue_id": 9469, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14267078", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9469#issuecomment-14267078", "updated_at": "2013-03-01T00:39:46Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld", "login": "rosenfeld", "gravatar_id": "2abdb50caf0dc5b510330f68b02db8e4", "html_url": "https://github.com/rosenfeld", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2abdb50caf0dc5b510330f68b02db8e4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c3aa93f86af77d8b1071d5fd2b4c91a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 32246, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-01T00:39:46Z", "id": 14267078, "owner": "rails"}
