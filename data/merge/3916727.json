For people whose performance is adversely affected by sequentially appending to a file, they can figure out where to disable it.   Given how niche that is, I don't think it needs to be advertised in production.rb. \r\n\r\nAs far as naming, the option should probably be called something like config.buffer_log_messages, or ideally config.logger.buffer_messages = true, but given that we let people assign any old thing to config.logger that's probably not possible.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381e2cbd3543c15100e669"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4998#issuecomment-3916727"}
