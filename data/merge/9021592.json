To learn CoffeeScript, you must first know Javascript. Thus, we can safely assume any CoffeeScript programmer can understand JavaScript & has the ability to convert given JavaScript code-sample into CoffeeScript. But Same is not true for JavaScript programmers. They will have trouble understanding what the code is doing thus defeating the entire purpose of this guide -- helping newbies get start with AJAX on rails.\r\n\r\n 2. We all know CoffeeScript is awesome & really easy to learn but there be always be people who prefer plain JS over its fancy avatar. reasons can be pragmatic like lack of proper debugging support to some silly reason but point being; currently, rails supports both.\r\n\r\nThat's why in guides, it would be a good idea to list code samples in JavaScript _AND_ CoffeeScript with CoffeeScript being the default. the interface could be a tabbed one, something like this:\r\n\r\n![mockup 1](http://screencloud.net/img/screenshots/91d985364f5086a127490adeb838f81c.png)\r\n![mockup 2](http://screencloud.net/img/screenshots/18887d83954880092a75a3b9963f62b6.png)\r\n\r\nDoing this makes a lot of sense to me. Let me know if this makes any sense to you guys. If yes, then I would send then  a PR to make this work.
