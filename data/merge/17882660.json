You can refer to the gist https://gist.github.com/aditya-kapoor/5574044 and here are the results which were run on my system\r\n\r\n                             user     system      total        real\r\nDefine Method   0.640000   0.040000   0.680000 (  0.680650)\r\nCalculating -------------------------------------\r\nCall using define Method\r\n                         68814 i/100ms\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nCall using define Method\r\n                      2324646.0 (\u00b10.7%) i/s -   11629566 in   5.002975s\r\n                    user     system      total        real\r\nClass Eval      4.970000   0.330000   5.300000 (  5.309989)\r\nCalculating -------------------------------------\r\nCall using class eval\r\n                         68715 i/100ms\r\n-------------------------------------------------\r\nCall using class eval\r\n                      2308585.6 (\u00b10.6%) i/s -   11544120 in   5.000716s\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the results above, there is hardly any difference in the runtime. If you have refered to the article written by @tenderlove this is the one area where the define_method is slightly slower than the class_eval...\r\n\r\nThe overall time ( defination time + calling time) for define_method is much more than the overall time for class_eval...correct me if I am wrong...\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dd47bd3543c151008aba"}, "issue_id": 10600, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17882660", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10600#issuecomment-17882660", "updated_at": "2013-05-14T15:16:14Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aditya-kapoor/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aditya-kapoor/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aditya-kapoor/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aditya-kapoor/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aditya-kapoor", "login": "aditya-kapoor", "gravatar_id": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/aditya-kapoor", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aditya-kapoor/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aditya-kapoor/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aditya-kapoor/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://identicons.github.com/d2498a88fe25cf7b0ec71ae5cd840747.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aditya-kapoor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1955930, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aditya-kapoor/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-14T15:16:14Z", "id": 17882660, "owner": "rails"}
