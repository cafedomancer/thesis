{"body": "Aloha, @tenderlove! I've been thinking about this and as much as I really wish there was a good way for an in-memory record to have identical attributes to those read through the association, the use case would be sufficiently rare that the solution here is probably \"good enough.\"\r\n\r\nInternal AR calls shouldn't be raising errors/deprecations (depending on version) that were intended to reflect changes being necessary to user code, so this patch avoids that. Swapping out the in-memory object for its from-disk counterpart would be bad for the reasons I mentioned the other day, and trying to step around the write_attribute protection against creating new attributes on an existing object (to use the in-memory version but graft on the additional attributes) is painful enough that I think the code is trying to tell us we'd be nuts to do it.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9233242", "created_at": "2012-10-08T17:22:43Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7859#issuecomment-9233242", "updated_at": "2012-10-08T17:22:43Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7859, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/ernie", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6a600c968f4e6a843dcaf600c1694e42.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "ernie", "type": "User", "id": 14947, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f833bd3543c15100b222"}, "id": 9233242, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7859"}
