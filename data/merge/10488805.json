I think stalling this patch until the guide is implemented is a very bad idea, because the current behaviour is wrong in the default case. This is an attempt to restore the correct default behaviour, and provide an option for people like @gazay who need the opposite.\r\n\r\nI also believe that @gingerlime is correct, and the current implementation is a (small) security vulnerability, since it allows IP address spoofing.", "_id": {"$oid": "523db5b8bd354364b90095de"}, "issue_id": 7980, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10488805", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7980#issuecomment-10488805", "updated_at": "2012-11-18T17:47:09Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/indirect/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/indirect/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/indirect/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/indirect/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/indirect", "login": "indirect", "gravatar_id": "4c3ed917e59156a36212d48155831482", "html_url": "https://github.com/indirect", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/indirect/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/indirect/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/indirect/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4c3ed917e59156a36212d48155831482?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F35f4a8d465e6e1edc05f3d8ab658c551.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/indirect/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 78, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/indirect/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-18T17:47:09Z", "id": 10488805, "owner": "rails"}
