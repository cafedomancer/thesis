{"body": "Could you also update a CHANGELOG, as shown here: http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#updating-the-changelog and fix commit message to comply with: http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#commit-your-changes? Regarding commit message, I'm talking about title, so it says: \"Add postgresql daterange type support\" or something like that, I guess you can skip longer description (although a code example or two would not hurt ;) ).\n\nAlso, it would be nice to document it, but I'm not sure what is the best place to add it. If there is no place where we document such things, I guess we can merge it and document later to not hold it for too long, but it would be great to have docs.\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7692841", "created_at": "2012-08-13T14:12:40Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7345#issuecomment-7692841", "updated_at": "2012-08-13T14:12:40Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7345, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/drogus", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3202111cf90e7c816a472aaceb72b0df.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/received_events", "gravatar_id": "582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "drogus", "type": "User", "id": 5004, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523df526bd354364b900bc49"}, "id": 7692841, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7345"}
