Regarding commit message, I'm talking about title, so it says: \"Add postgresql daterange type support\" or something like that, I guess you can skip longer description (although a code example or two would not hurt ;) ).\n\nAlso, it would be nice to document it, but I'm not sure what is the best place to add it. If there is no place where we document such things, I guess we can merge it and document later to not hold it for too long, but it would be great to have docs.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523df526bd354364b900bc49"}, "issue_id": 7345, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7692841", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7345#issuecomment-7692841", "updated_at": "2012-08-13T14:12:40Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus", "login": "drogus", "gravatar_id": "582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30", "html_url": "https://github.com/drogus", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3202111cf90e7c816a472aaceb72b0df.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5004, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-13T14:12:40Z", "id": 7692841, "owner": "rails"}
