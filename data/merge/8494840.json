{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7614", "repo": "rails", "body": "`--skip-git` will skip creation of the `.gitignore` *and* `.gitkeep` files. The keep files are useful to source control systems other than git. Perforce, for instance, also needs files present to track a folder. Just because I'm not using git doesn't mean I don't want to keep Rails' empty folders around. \n\nPerhaps a better, simpler solution is:\n1. Change the generator to name the `.gitkeep` files in a more SCM-agnostic way (e.g. `.keep`).\n2. Change `--skip-git` so that it only skips the `.gitignore` file and still generates `.keep`.\n\nCurrently, the `--skip-git` option is enticing to people who use other SCMs but it might not be what they really want. They don't want to lose those empty folders. What they should do is generate the project as usual, but then delete the .gitignore file and rename all the .gitkeep files to something a bit more agnostic.\n\nRenaming the files might seem like minutia, but why be git-centric when there's no reason to be?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f9c1bd3543c15100b4e8"}, "issue_id": 7614, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8494840", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7614#issuecomment-8494840", "updated_at": "2012-09-12T14:17:17Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekprior/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekprior/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekprior/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekprior/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekprior", "login": "derekprior", "gravatar_id": "79b1b001d5ff186c9bd02e7487aa4142", "html_url": "https://github.com/derekprior", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekprior/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekprior/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekprior/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/79b1b001d5ff186c9bd02e7487aa4142?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F00d021a70eb568ae3a6778add4fed2e9.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekprior/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 152152, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/derekprior/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-12T14:13:15Z", "id": 8494840, "owner": "rails"}
