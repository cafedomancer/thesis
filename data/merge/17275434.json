{"body": "This is really exciting, my original intention for ``:inverse_of`` was that it be automatic.  Indeed in the [parental_control plugin](https://github.com/h-lame/parental_control/) the feature was extracted from, it always was automatic.  \r\n\r\nThere's some work in there that might be useful to look at, particularly https://github.com/h-lame/parental_control/blob/master/lib/parental_control.rb#L17 onwards.

It's been a while since I used ``parental_control`` (it's a *plugin* after all) but I'm not sure that it has that constraint, so if you can stomach comparing rails 2.3 plugin code to rails 4.0-ish internals it might be worth comparing the approaches.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17275434", "created_at": "2013-05-01T10:07:01Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9522#issuecomment-17275434", "updated_at": "2013-05-01T10:07:01Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9522, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h-lame/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h-lame/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h-lame/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/h-lame", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h-lame/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/h-lame", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h-lame/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/54b777de593ec82e8db8f40457e6cc1e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F996a7fa078cc36c46d02f9af3bef918b.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h-lame/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h-lame/received_events", "gravatar_id": "54b777de593ec82e8db8f40457e6cc1e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h-lame/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "h-lame", "type": "User", "id": 608, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h-lame/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1ea1bd354364b9004dce"}, "id": 17275434, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9522"}
