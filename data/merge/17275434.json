Indeed in the [parental_control plugin](https://github.com/h-lame/parental_control/) the feature was extracted from, it always was automatic.  \r\n\r\nThere's some work in there that might be useful to look at, particularly https://github.com/h-lame/parental_control/blob/master/lib/parental_control.rb#L17 onwards.  It looks like you've got everything covered, but I notice that you explicitly discard associations with the ``class_name`` option set.  It's been a while since I used ``parental_control`` (it's a *plugin* after all) but I'm not sure that it has that constraint, so if you can stomach comparing rails 2.3 plugin code to rails 4.0-ish internals it might be worth comparing the approaches.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1ea1bd354364b9004dce"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9522#issuecomment-17275434"}
