{"body": "@carlosantoniodasilva I have one more doubt on this commit. Because of the code at https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva/rails/commit/23b9cc84230042aaf7f824d70e010d7678350ec3#L1R32 , `not` accepts conditions **in three formats**: Hash, String and Array, so these lines are equivalent:\r\n\r\n    Post.where.not(title: 'hello')\r\n    Post.where.not(\"title = 'hello'\")\r\n    Post.where.not(['title = ?', 'hello'])\r\n\r\nMy *doubt* (also for @amatsuda) is the following: **why** do we allow `not` to accept conditions in three formats, whereas we only allow the Hash format for `like` and `not_like`?\r\n\r\nI think that we should **keep coherence among** the WhereChain methods: they should all accept the same types of parameters. Therefore, I see two options:\r\n\r\n1) removing support for String and Array conditions from `not`\r\n\r\n2) adding support for String and Array conditions to `like` and `not_like`.\r\n\r\n@carlosantoniodasilva and @amatsuda what is your opinion on this?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd vote for option 1) since I don't see a big advantage in writing code like:\r\n\r\n    Post.where.like('name' = 'jon%')\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n    Post.where.like(['name = ?', 'jon%'])\r\n\r\nrather than:\r\n\r\n    Post.where('name like \"jon%\"')\r\n\r\nImplementing this support would also be cumbersome, since we would have to transform the equal sign in `'name' = 'jon%'` into a `LIKE` SQL statement.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11124635", "created_at": "2012-12-07T09:58:26Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8332#issuecomment-11124635", "updated_at": "2012-12-07T09:58:26Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8332, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/claudiob", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/4dea5cf83d2d6c1228750b76e579b38d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F11ed516444b2593eaba7f2c2bb63483e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/received_events", "gravatar_id": "4dea5cf83d2d6c1228750b76e579b38d", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "claudiob", "type": "User", "id": 10076, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claudiob/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523d97adbd354364b9008307"}, "id": 11124635, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8332"}
