Because of the code at https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva/rails/commit/23b9cc84230042aaf7f824d70e010d7678350ec3#L1R32 , `not` accepts conditions **in three formats**: Hash, String and Array, so these lines are equivalent:\r\n\r\n    Post.where.not(title: 'hello')\r\n    Post.where.not(\"title = 'hello'\")\r\n    Post.where.not(['title = ?', 'hello'])\r\n\r\nMy *doubt* (also for @amatsuda) is the following: **why** do we allow `not` to accept conditions in three formats, whereas we only allow the Hash format for `like` and `not_like`?\r\n\r\nI think that we should **keep coherence among** the WhereChain methods: they should all accept the same types of parameters. Therefore, I see two options:\r\n\r\n1) removing support for String and Array conditions from `not`\r\n\r\n2) adding support for String and Array conditions to `like` and `not_like`.\r\n\r\n@carlosantoniodasilva and @amatsuda what is your opinion on this?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd vote for option 1) since I don't see a big advantage in writing code like:\r\n\r\n    Post.where.like('name' = 'jon%')\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n    Post.where.like(['name = ?', 'jon%'])\r\n\r\nrather than:\r\n\r\n    Post.where('name like \"jon%\"')\r\n\r\nImplementing this support would also be cumbersome, since we would have to transform the equal sign in `'name' = 'jon%'` into a `LIKE` SQL statement.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523d97adbd354364b9008307"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8332#issuecomment-11124635"}
