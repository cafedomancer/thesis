I didn't want to hard-code a list of strings, because the adapters my change anytime and it didn't seem a perfect solution either. Solution to the dilemma: embrace imperfection :).\n\nAnd even if you could avoid the generation depending on the adapter in a good way, this pull request would still make sense to me because it is not uncommon that you generate whatever to bootstrap, or you just forget to use the database flag of the generator, and later you edit _config/database.yml_ to change the adapter.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380cb5bd3543c15100d1c6"}, "issue_id": 6197, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5775462", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6197#issuecomment-5775462", "updated_at": "2012-05-17T22:08:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-17T22:08:15Z", "id": 5775462, "owner": "rails"}
