If what you are saying is correct, db:test:prepare should not be working at all in master. Which means no one using PostgreSQL is able to run tests via the standard rake task.\r\n\r\nNow that I think of it, however, I did only test the change as it applies to the 3-2-stable branch and not master. I will re-test against master. If something is wrong, I suspect that it's not because of the changes in this patch.", "_id": {"$oid": "523820c2bd3543c15100e90b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4834#issuecomment-3806968"}
