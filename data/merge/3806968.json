{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/4834", "repo": "rails", "body": "That's very strange, Chris, because my change only removes passing in the template as the last argument. If what you are saying is correct, db:test:prepare should not be working at all in master. Which means no one using PostgreSQL is able to run tests via the standard rake task.\r\n\r\nNow that I think of it, however, I did only test the change as it applies to the 3-2-stable branch and not master. I will re-test against master. If something is wrong, I suspect that it's not because of the changes in this patch.", "_id": {"$oid": "523820c2bd3543c15100e90b"}, "issue_id": 4834, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3806968", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4834#issuecomment-3806968", "updated_at": "2012-02-04T03:28:00Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby", "login": "sskirby", "gravatar_id": "4d4c378e3a10e2d01a636a33c359734c", "html_url": "https://github.com/sskirby", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4d4c378e3a10e2d01a636a33c359734c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6f3e24662182e125fc58299809ee6a67.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 25760, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-02-04T00:33:54Z", "id": 3806968, "owner": "rails"}
