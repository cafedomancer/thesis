{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9704", "repo": "rails", "body": "> Whether we raise or log a warning on a duplicate name is a matter of preference - I've no strong feelings either way. \r\n\r\nRaising an error is a backwards incompatible change for anyone who has the same URL routing to different controllers/actions based on constraints. The issue, to me, is that this change causes an error about duplicate route definition based only on URL. When a request passes through the router, the URL is not the only part that determines where a request ultimately ends up.\r\n\r\nI agree that helping developers discover that they've duplicated a route is a useful feature. I vote for logging it instead of raising.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d10fbbd354364b90046a3"}, "issue_id": 9704, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17317893", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9704#issuecomment-17317893", "updated_at": "2013-05-02T02:45:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/latortuga/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/latortuga/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/latortuga/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/latortuga/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/latortuga", "login": "latortuga", "gravatar_id": "52768c312df1986d42157a7e51401705", "html_url": "https://github.com/latortuga", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/latortuga/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/latortuga/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/latortuga/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/52768c312df1986d42157a7e51401705?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc9a8a89997dec2c49626cd70b7849142.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/latortuga/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9379, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/latortuga/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-02T02:45:15Z", "id": 17317893, "owner": "rails"}
