I don't understand why we would be limiting current_page to just GET requests.\r\n\r\nExample scenario:\r\nlocalhost:3000/subscriptions\r\nuser submits a form successfully\r\ncurrent_page? returns false on re-render (to /subscriptions)\r\n\r\nRoutes:\r\n```ruby\r\nresource :subscriptions, only: [:edit, :update]\r\nget '/subscriptions' => 'subscriptions#edit'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a quick hack for the current_page? method on a POST for anyone else coming across this. If your subscriptions page posts to /waffles, the below will re-highlight 'Subscriptions' in the nav.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef active_page(*path)\r\n  \"active\" if current_page?(path.first) || path.include?(request.fullpath)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n<li><%= link_to 'Subscriptions', subscriptions_path, class: active_page(subscriptions_path, waffles_path) %></li>\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "52383eddbd3543c15101062e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2815#issuecomment-19983048"}
