{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2815", "repo": "rails", "body": "@spastorino I have the same problem as @mosinandrey here with navigation not re-highlighting after a POST (via a class in nav). I don't understand why we would be limiting current_page to just GET requests.\r\n\r\nExample scenario:\r\nlocalhost:3000/subscriptions\r\nuser submits a form successfully\r\ncurrent_page? returns false on re-render (to /subscriptions)\r\n\r\nRoutes:\r\n```ruby\r\nresource :subscriptions, only: [:edit, :update]\r\nget '/subscriptions' => 'subscriptions#edit'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a quick hack for the current_page? method on a POST for anyone else coming across this. If your subscriptions page posts to /waffles, the below will re-highlight 'Subscriptions' in the nav.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef active_page(*path)\r\n  \"active\" if current_page?(path.first) || path.include?(request.fullpath)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n<li><%= link_to 'Subscriptions', subscriptions_path, class: active_page(subscriptions_path, waffles_path) %></li>\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "52383eddbd3543c15101062e"}, "issue_id": 2815, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/19983048", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2815#issuecomment-19983048", "updated_at": "2013-06-25T15:16:55Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RyanonRails/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RyanonRails/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RyanonRails/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RyanonRails/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/RyanonRails", "login": "RyanonRails", "gravatar_id": "e4c941f8a884c37a92a2a7084b3fca3d", "html_url": "https://github.com/RyanonRails", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RyanonRails/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RyanonRails/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RyanonRails/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e4c941f8a884c37a92a2a7084b3fca3d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbf24fa5a680f6d119906fb47dde39639.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RyanonRails/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 350391, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RyanonRails/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-06-25T15:10:58Z", "id": 19983048, "owner": "rails"}
