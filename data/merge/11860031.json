This also cleans up @jstin's concern about `Hash` and `Array` being hardcoded.\r\n\r\n@rafaelfranca my thoughts are that setting `nil` on an invalid argument is clearer and safer than leaving the value in its original state. Firstly, it's more likely to be caught by a validation or `:null => false` constraint. Setting `nil` also makes it clear that the assignment was at least attempted by AR, rather than leaving you wondering if something intercepted the call before it got there.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f092bd3543c15100a2e5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8718#issuecomment-11860031"}
