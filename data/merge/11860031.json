{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8718", "repo": "rails", "body": "Updated to handle the AR object situation that @carlosantoniodasilva identified - now uses `to_i` then `id`, finally setting `nil` if nothing else can be done. This also cleans up @jstin's concern about `Hash` and `Array` being hardcoded.\r\n\r\n@rafaelfranca my thoughts are that setting `nil` on an invalid argument is clearer and safer than leaving the value in its original state. Firstly, it's more likely to be caught by a validation or `:null => false` constraint. Setting `nil` also makes it clear that the assignment was at least attempted by AR, rather than leaving you wondering if something intercepted the call before it got there.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f092bd3543c15100a2e5"}, "issue_id": 8718, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11860031", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8718#issuecomment-11860031", "updated_at": "2013-01-03T20:45:30Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jstirk/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jstirk/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jstirk/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jstirk/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jstirk", "login": "jstirk", "gravatar_id": "9155bf296c0cc5450b0b8edc82d149dd", "html_url": "https://github.com/jstirk", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jstirk/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jstirk/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jstirk/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9155bf296c0cc5450b0b8edc82d149dd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb607aa5b2fd58dd860bfb55619389982.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jstirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4892, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jstirk/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-03T20:45:30Z", "id": 11860031, "owner": "rails"}
