There was a fair amount of refactoring done here between 3.0 and 3.1 in the ActiveRecord API.\r\n\r\nThe issue of nested attributes being assigned before the base attributes were set didn't come up for some reason in 3.0, but it was an issue in 3.1, so making sure base attributes were assigned first was the final step in getting things to work.  The hash \"order\" seemed to be \"good enough\" in 3.0, but not in 3.1.", "_id": {"$oid": "523f420fbd354364b90164ed"}, "issue_id": 3991, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3166372", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3991#issuecomment-3166372", "updated_at": "2011-12-15T18:10:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick", "login": "akaspick", "gravatar_id": "898bf26eb61308fe717a243441cc615d", "html_url": "https://github.com/akaspick", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/898bf26eb61308fe717a243441cc615d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F82c3cf12914d43d34d8883ec88307da2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 24056, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akaspick/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-15T18:10:29Z", "id": 3166372, "owner": "rails"}
