{"body": "About first plan.\r\n\r\nI thought that the first plan (HWIA has two mode) was good.\r\nBut I think this approach is no good now.\r\nBecause if HWIA has a flag about convert or no-convert, it isn't useful and this problem cann't be solved.\r\n\r\nSo, I thought the new plan.\r\n\r\nWe've had Hash#nested_under_indifferent_access already.\r\nIf Hash#nested_under_indifferent_access returns self, this hash isn't converted.\r\n\r\nThis idea's implementation is 759654e97d0e27ef0b5376b526564fb3da37354e , be3a7c7134a55fbcc12d6e66edd9ea524503c114 and 30baa5bd76153c3f8c83e9f7d60f42501a09b1fa .\r\n\r\n759654e97d0e27ef0b5376b526564fb3da37354e is testcase for this problem.\r\nbe3a7c7134a55fbcc12d6e66edd9ea524503c114 is necessary because subclass_from_attrs method is called before assigning every attribute .\r\n30baa5bd76153c3f8c83e9f7d60f42501a09b1fa is my new idea . \r\n\r\nIf HashWithoutIndifferentAccess isn't good naming, please teach me proper name.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18848776", "created_at": "2013-06-03T15:24:24Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10784#issuecomment-18848776", "updated_at": "2013-06-03T15:45:16Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 10784, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/kennyj", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/1f0b221851379759360d7130dabdfa53?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F54ecc28e9508fcf28363014b0d1b4eb8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/received_events", "gravatar_id": "1f0b221851379759360d7130dabdfa53", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "kennyj", "type": "User", "id": 13426, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kennyj/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dbbfbd3543c1510088e0"}, "id": 18848776, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10784"}
