{"body": "Yes, the asymmetry is intentional. `rake test` only runs what it knows about. `rake test:all` is meant to pick everything up in one go. If you want to add a new test dir that gets picked up by `rake test` then you should tell the `test:run` task about it. Personally I think the way that `test:run` is implemented is inflexible and a bit inane, but there ya go. The easiest way to go about that is to simply add a dependency:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ntask \"test:all\" => \"test:mynewthing\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be better if `test:all` were refactored so you can modify that array easily. Or better if they'd just, you know, use dependencies properly. I'll look into the refactoring after lunch.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14584713", "created_at": "2013-03-07T20:38:59Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9177#issuecomment-14584713", "updated_at": "2013-03-07T20:38:59Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9177, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zenspider/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zenspider/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zenspider/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/zenspider", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zenspider/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/zenspider", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zenspider/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/16c4b19d8670085a428787f8b2438223?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd08726019e4a2a15cb1d49092e4d0522.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zenspider/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zenspider/received_events", "gravatar_id": "16c4b19d8670085a428787f8b2438223", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zenspider/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "zenspider", "type": "User", "id": 9832, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zenspider/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ec6abd3543c151009cd1"}, "id": 14584713, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9177"}
