If you want to add a new test dir that gets picked up by `rake test` then you should tell the `test:run` task about it. Personally I think the way that `test:run` is implemented is inflexible and a bit inane, but there ya go. The easiest way to go about that is to simply add a dependency:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ntask \"test:all\" => \"test:mynewthing\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be better if `test:all` were refactored so you can modify that array easily. Or better if they'd just, you know, use dependencies properly. I'll look into the refactoring after lunch.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ec6abd3543c151009cd1"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9177#issuecomment-14584713"}
