{"body": "I can add a CHANGELOG entry to the pull request commit (I wasn't sure if\r\nALL changes were supposed to have CHANGELOG or not). The problem is if I do\r\nthat, and then this sits for another two weeks, the CHANGELOG prob wont'\r\nmerge anymore since there will have been other changes to the top of the\r\nCHANGELOG, right?  I will add a CHANGELOG entry to the commit if I get some\r\nindication that it'll be merged after that instead of going stale, does\r\nthat make sense?\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Sep 24, 2012 at 1:27 PM, Rafael Mendon\u00e7a Fran\u00e7a <\r\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> We will need a CHANGELOG entry\r\n>\r\n> \u2014\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub<https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7684#issuecomment-8827006>.\r\n>\r\n>", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8830402", "created_at": "2012-09-24T19:01:59Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7684#issuecomment-8830402", "updated_at": "2012-09-24T19:01:59Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7684, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jrochkind", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6a13e655e637138f8d571cec3f9cea76?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd54ea80e1dddb765bab019d4dfe36c23.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/received_events", "gravatar_id": "6a13e655e637138f8d571cec3f9cea76", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jrochkind", "type": "User", "id": 149304, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523dd161bd354364b900a701"}, "id": 8830402, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7684"}
