{"body": "+1 for revert.\r\n\r\nToday I set up a new machine and `rake db:create` then `db:migrate` generated a different `schema.rb` than what's committed in our git repo.\r\n\r\nThat means `schema.rb` could be inconsistent between our team members, or worse, different from what's already deployed on production.\r\n\r\nIn other words,\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate_table :sometable do |t|\r\n  t.timestamps\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nin migrations could mean different things, depending on when it got run - before or after this change was introduced. This is nondeterministic situation.\r\n\r\nI think we need incremental, trackable `schema.rb` to make this change acceptable.\r\n\r\nFor now, I'll have to instruct new developers to our team that they should not commit this change in `schema.rb` and run `git reset --hard` instead, when they finished setup.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4524682", "created_at": "2012-03-15T17:33:46Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3334#issuecomment-4524682", "updated_at": "2012-03-15T17:33:46Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3334, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/kenn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f3c42aa7989a9a0c37709abc08a6327f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F20d749bc05f47d2bd3026ce457dcfd8e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f3c42aa7989a9a0c37709abc08a6327f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "kenn", "type": "User", "id": 10350, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238378fbd3543c15100fe95"}, "id": 4524682, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3334"}
