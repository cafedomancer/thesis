This is nondeterministic situation.\r\n\r\nI think we need incremental, trackable `schema.rb` to make this change acceptable.\r\n\r\nFor now, I'll have to instruct new developers to our team that they should not commit this change in `schema.rb` and run `git reset --hard` instead, when they finished setup.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238378fbd3543c15100fe95"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3334#issuecomment-4524682"}
