Unfortunately what you are proposing is to add an order clause to almost all queries which do not need it", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138cf"}, "issue_id": 5153, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4634147", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4634147", "updated_at": "2012-03-22T08:10:55Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho", "login": "Systho", "gravatar_id": "ae62505fba91b9ae398bbd84554a21b9", "html_url": "https://github.com/Systho", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ae62505fba91b9ae398bbd84554a21b9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9a08173505ddb28ef127627901de2918.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 47462, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Systho/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-22T08:10:55Z", "id": 4634147, "owner": "rails"}
