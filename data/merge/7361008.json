There are a few things to discuss though:\n\n1) Today, we make the default `I18n.default_locale`, I think this is a bad idea because it can lead to your tables and other internal information to be inflected using another locale than `:en`. I believe we should default to `:en`, even more because `I18n.default_locale` doesn't mean anything, if your application has more than one locale, it will be at least half of the time the wrong one (and if it has only one locale, you simply don't care).\n\n2) underscore, camelize, titleize, etc do not accept a locale. I am not sure if this is a deliberate decision, but I believe it should be discussed. Although I can see how some would never be used with a locale, like underscore, titleize and humanize seem expected to accept a locale.\n\n3) We should probably update `config/initializers/inflections.rb` file that ships with Rails with the new info", "_id": {"$oid": "523e029fbd354364b900c60d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7197#issuecomment-7361008"}
