{"body": "Thanks! However, the solution is a bit backwards because Mime::Type should not know about `AbstractController`. A possible solution is to register callbacks in Mime::Type and notify these callbacks whenever a new mime is added. For example, inside `AbstractController::Collector`:\n\n    Mime::Type.register_callback do |mime|\n      generate_method_for_mime(mime)\n    end\n\nAnd then:\n\n    class Mime::Type\n      @callbacks = []\n\n      def self.register_callback(&block)\n        @callbacks << block\n      end\n    end\n\nAnd then you can invoke the callbacks every time a new mime is added.
