{"body": "After digging a while into git history, I think this is what happened:\r\n\r\nIn `master` branch, part of the code introduced by cfc95d89aeffba5a026afcf272bdf3ff231a8983 (included in this pull request) was later modified in 6a28c512e358a95bbabd24af9d2b0608df787158.\r\n\r\nInstead of porting the two commits to `3.1.2`, only the last commit was ported. It was not ported exactly as it was, it was modified instead, and the changes included code from the first commit (???). This changes resulted in commit 818d285305502cc6191a98400b43633f44394f6e.\r\n\r\nThis pull request also includes tests, but they were not ported to `3.1.2` at all.\r\n\r\nSo, the problem solved by this pull request seems to be already solved in `3.1.2` by 818d285305502cc6191a98400b43633f44394f6e. The only missing part are tests.\r\n\r\nDo I create a pull request to back-port tests?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2736654", "created_at": "2011-11-14T21:14:12Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3232#issuecomment-2736654", "updated_at": "2011-11-14T21:14:12Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3232, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/Juanmcuello", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f63a259f9b2375e2e900b8cfcc1420fd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ab50a3e04f83906aac563629a76f88d.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f63a259f9b2375e2e900b8cfcc1420fd", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "Juanmcuello", "type": "User", "id": 112913, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383931bd3543c15101008c"}, "id": 2736654, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3232"}
