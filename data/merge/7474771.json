{"body": "Thanks Pete, it just sounded like a lot of people were saying that they use\nit and that it's useful and only a few don't and want to remove it. I\nagree, it should work well, and provided the functionality was replicated\nelsewhere, I see no problem in removing it from here. I agree with you that\nmoving it into STI makes more sense.\n\nA good quality guide to STI is a good idea. I've always found myself\nbrowsing often conflicting opinions on how to implement STI with relation\n to controllers and views. A good guide should also help drive development\nof STI in the future in an agreed upon direction?\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Aug 2, 2012 at 10:38 AM, Pete B <\nreply@reply.github.com\n> wrote:\n\n> @brendon From what I can see, no one is saying they want to remove it\n> because they don't use it.
