Are you serious man? Steve, not me, Roy Fielding is telling your reading of the spec is wrong.\r\n\r\nPlease read rest-discuss, please read O'Reilly's book on REST, and have a pulse about how people think what's PUT. There's consensus about the meaning of PUT. That's my sample, not the people in the PR.\r\n\r\nThe problem this solves is to ease users of Ruby on Rails to follow HTTP semantics, now it's possible but the design should favor PATCH over PUT due to practical needs of most web applications.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c7ebd3543c15100e4d6"}, "issue_id": 5130, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4194168", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5130#issuecomment-4194168", "updated_at": "2012-02-27T14:20:10Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-02-27T14:20:10Z", "id": 4194168, "owner": "rails"}
