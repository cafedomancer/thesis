You'd have to clone your repo (with the private/ssh link), and do something like this:\n\n```shell\ngit checkout patch-1\ngit rebase -i head~2\n# an editor should open, you will have to mark the last commit as squash, save and close\ngit push --force lazylester patch1\n```\n\nAfter that you should have only 1 commit with the required change. Make sure the message is the clear one, as we commented before.\n\n[Take a look here for more info on squashing](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)\n\nHope that helps, if you have any other doubt, let me know.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380761bd3543c15100ca9e"}, "issue_id": 6499, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7910085", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6499#issuecomment-7910085", "updated_at": "2012-08-21T18:01:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-21T18:01:42Z", "id": 7910085, "owner": "rails"}
