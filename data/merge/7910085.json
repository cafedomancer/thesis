You'd have to clone your repo (with the private/ssh link), and do something like this:\n\n```shell\ngit checkout patch-1\ngit rebase -i head~2\n# an editor should open, you will have to mark the last commit as squash, save and close\ngit push --force lazylester patch1\n```\n\nAfter that you should have only 1 commit with the required change. Make sure the message is the clear one, as we commented before.\n\n[Take a look here for more info on squashing](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)\n\nHope that helps, if you have any other doubt, let me know.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380761bd3543c15100ca9e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6499#issuecomment-7910085"}
