{"body": "Sorry for delay, I had a lot of work. I've started to work on appending formats for both renderers. I've updated commit but now it has 2 failing tests and both are associated with layout:\n1) https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/test/controller/new_base/render_layout_test.rb#L93-96\nWhen incoming format `:html`, but template doesn't contain format in extension. When I'm trying to add new format it renders layout, because `:xml` added after `:html`. It didn't happen when formats were totally replaced.\n2) https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/test/controller/render_test.rb#L1050-1053\nWhen request xhr it contains `*/*` and by default it matches all formats, and I should append there new format. It skips layout in my case because first format is `:js`, whereas with replacement it works good because all formats is replaced on `:html`.
