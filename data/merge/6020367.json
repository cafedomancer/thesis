{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6492", "repo": "rails", "body": "Better news. The production app I was testing this in was missing an rdbms index. (The app is in the middle of a migration from Rails 2.1 to modern 3.2). \n\nThat led to some slow db queries that:\n* Resulted in some slow db action (and thus more simultaneous connections required) that I mistakenly guessed was related to this patch. \n* May also have triggered some edge case that resulted in the weird polling even when num_connections > num_available. \n\nAt any rate, I am currently testing this code (or a backported version of it monkeypatched into 3.2.3) in production app under production load -- and everything is currently looking _great_, def better than any previous Rails 3.x ConnectionPool implementation, for my particular app. \n\n\nMy custom backport/monkey-patched code also still has the 3.2.3 `clear_stale_cached_connections!` implementation, using the expensive `Thread.list` call, and with the 3.2.3 log when leaked connections are reclaimed. That log line is **not** being output, meaning there is no reason to believe there are any leaked connections in this app. \n\n\nSo I think this is good code. My personal experience with production-level loads for my particular app leads me to endorse this code going into master, and possibly being backported to 3.2.3.
