{"body": "@pixeltrix thanks!\n\n@jamie @pixeltrix But I want to say that maybe it's a thin moment... If we right\n```ruby\nresources :products, :only => :show\nresources :products, :param => :slug, :only => :show\n```\nwe get\n```ruby\nscope '/products' do\n  controller 'products' do\n    get    '/:id/edit', :action => 'edit',  :as => :edit_product\n  end\nend\n\nscope '/products' do\n  controller 'products' do\n    get    '/:slug/edit', :action => 'edit',  :as => :edit_product\n  end\nend\n```\nAm I right? If yes we get to `get`s with `:as => :edit_product`.
