Why did you revert it? We are currently migrating project from Rails 3 to Rails 4 and have a mess: \r\n\r\n1. Some of tables have not-nullable constrains, some of table doesn't have. \r\n2. Some of developers applied last migrations with Rails 3 environment, some of developers with Rails 4. So we have diffs like that on each pull-request:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+    t.datetime \"created_at\",                   null: false\r\n+    t.datetime \"updated_at\",                   null: false\r\n\r\n-    t.datetime \"created_at\",                   null: false\r\n-    t.datetime \"updated_at\",                   null: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy do you think, :created_at and :updated_at should be nullable by default?", "_id": {"$oid": "5250f51bbd35437be6002219"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7095#issuecomment-25159993"}
