From time to time it gets cross-merged with the main Rails repo, after some review/copy-edit.\r\n\r\nSo if you guys find anything else, please feel free to send a commit there fixing it (of course there's no problem sending in here too if you want it to get reviewed sooner ;).", "_id": {"$oid": "523d191dbd354364b90049b8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9630#issuecomment-14668705"}
