From time to time it gets cross-merged with the main Rails repo, after some review/copy-edit.\r\n\r\nSo if you guys find anything else, please feel free to send a commit there fixing it (of course there's no problem sending in here too if you want it to get reviewed sooner ;).", "_id": {"$oid": "523d191dbd354364b90049b8"}, "issue_id": 9630, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14668705", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9630#issuecomment-14668705", "updated_at": "2013-03-09T19:14:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-09T19:14:15Z", "id": 14668705, "owner": "rails"}
