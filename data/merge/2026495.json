{"body": "Hiya, I am a bit confused about what you are fixing:\r\n\r\n* You say \"assert_select_email didn't work at all on emails that weren't multipart\", but the test you have written relates to a multipart email\r\n* Regarding \"converting the Mail::Body to a string to prevent errors\", how does this error occur? What does the backtrace look like when it happens? Is it covered by a test?\r\n\r\nThanks", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2026495", "created_at": "2011-09-07T07:59:45Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2499#issuecomment-2026495", "updated_at": "2011-09-07T07:59:45Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 2499, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jonleighton", "type": "User", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523842fcbd3543c151010b8a"}, "id": 2026495, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2499"}
