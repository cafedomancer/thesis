{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6463", "repo": "rails", "body": "@rafaelfranca  yeah, that was my concern, changing the api. There's no way to fix this without changing the api for _something_. But it might be 'safer' (although more confusing)  to change the api for mysql2 instead of ConnectionPool -- but it's nto entirely clear to me. \n\nNobody using rails 3.2.x as is, with mysql2, could possibly be setting the ConnectionPool timeout to a reasonable value without messing up their app, it wouldn't work.  On the other hand, they might be using `wait_timeout` _intending_ it to apply to mysql2 (a very high value), and if not doing multi-threading not noticing that that's a much higher value than they'd want for ConnectionPool's timeout. \n\nSo I'm not really sure what can/should be done in 3-2-stable.  And the fact that it seems unlikely there will be another 3.2.x release incorporating any fixes lowers my motivation to spend much time on it. \n\nBut if anyone makes the call on what should happen and thinks it's worth doing, I'll prepare a backport pull for 3-2-stable (woudln't have to involve the Reaper, which doesn't exist in 3-2-stable). \n\nPersonally, I'll probably be monkey patching in 3.2.3, but I dont' need to worry about anyone elses's backwards compat but my own.
