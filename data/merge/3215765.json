However, we need to be very careful about the module order. Probably something in date_helper.rb would have to reference ActiveModelHelper just to force the ActiveModelInstaceTag to be loaded and added to InstaceTag before. Another option (which is better imho) is to have InstanceTag including those modules on their own and in one file.
