We have a task rake secret, but all that does is print a new random secret out to stdout.  There's no KeyCzar style functionality for rotating those keys.  However users can simply change it and rails will silently discard the old cookies / sessions.  Previously it has raised exceptions however you get *lots* of false positives with mis-behaving bots and proxies truncating the headers.\n\nMy plan for the salts is that they're config values to the application with *hard coded* defaults.  f.ex to sign cookies we may have a config value\n\n```ruby\n  config.something.cookie_signature_salt = \"7da55e95cab4feae54f0a8af22a4e0a1280b63b5d5055948066\"\n```\n\nBut if the value's not set by the user, simply default it to some known value like \"org.rubyonrails.cookies.signature\"?", "_id": {"$oid": "52380195bd3543c15100c178"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6952#issuecomment-6956455"}
