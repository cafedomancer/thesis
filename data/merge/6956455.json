We have a task rake secret, but all that does is print a new random secret out to stdout.  There's no KeyCzar style functionality for rotating those keys.  However users can simply change it and rails will silently discard the old cookies / sessions.  Previously it has raised exceptions however you get *lots* of false positives with mis-behaving bots and proxies truncating the headers.\n\nMy plan for the salts is that they're config values to the application with *hard coded* defaults.  f.ex to sign cookies we may have a config value\n\n```ruby\n  config.something.cookie_signature_salt = \"7da55e95cab4feae54f0a8af22a4e0a1280b63b5d5055948066\"\n```\n\nBut if the value's not set by the user, simply default it to some known value like \"org.rubyonrails.cookies.signature\"?", "_id": {"$oid": "52380195bd3543c15100c178"}, "issue_id": 6952, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6956455", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6952#issuecomment-6956455", "updated_at": "2012-07-13T07:34:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-13T07:34:28Z", "id": 6956455, "owner": "rails"}
