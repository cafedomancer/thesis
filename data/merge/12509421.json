The ActiveRecord object doesn't need to know anything about the transaction except whether it is committed or rolled back, so I thought it would be more modular that way. \r\n\r\nI'm trying to fix the issue where each transaction holds pointers to many ActiveRecord objects, which prevent them from being garbage collected. I'm going to try to make it so that each active record object has a pointer to a TransactionState object, and using this state object, can correctly provide its attributes to the user.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5df2bd354364b900630e"}, "issue_id": 9011, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12509421", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9011#issuecomment-12509421", "updated_at": "2013-01-21T17:56:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn", "login": "wangjohn", "gravatar_id": "ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab", "html_url": "https://github.com/wangjohn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1075780, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-21T17:56:29Z", "id": 12509421, "owner": "rails"}
