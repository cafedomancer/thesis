{"body": "@fxn : Nice, thanks!\r\n\r\n@egilburg : I've added your link at the end of the guide. Indeed, it seems to be another nice alternative to fixtures.\r\n\r\nAbout the shoulda link, I would love to have your feedback guys : shoulda is just a meta gems which ships with `shoulda-matchers` (which is an extensions for RSpec) and `shoulda-context` (which is an extension for `test/unit`). Should we update the link to point to the shoulda repository or only shoulda-context since we aren't speaking about RSpec in the guide (except a link at the end of the file)?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20003702", "created_at": "2013-06-25T20:13:20Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11059#issuecomment-20003702", "updated_at": "2013-06-25T20:13:20Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 11059, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/robin850", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2d27b53e2eeb6a053552332020628029?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fafc5fd60924eb324ae549e95c93f0643.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2d27b53e2eeb6a053552332020628029", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "robin850", "type": "User", "id": 354185, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523c9d76bd354364b9001b07"}, "id": 20003702, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11059"}
