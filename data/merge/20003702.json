Indeed, it seems to be another nice alternative to fixtures.\r\n\r\nAbout the shoulda link, I would love to have your feedback guys : shoulda is just a meta gems which ships with `shoulda-matchers` (which is an extensions for RSpec) and `shoulda-context` (which is an extension for `test/unit`). Should we update the link to point to the shoulda repository or only shoulda-context since we aren't speaking about RSpec in the guide (except a link at the end of the file)?", "_id": {"$oid": "523c9d76bd354364b9001b07"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11059#issuecomment-20003702"}
