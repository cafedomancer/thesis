However, these changes are *not* in the 3.2.12 release. It seems odd that there is such a discrepancy.\r\n\r\nI do understand that this is because the recent `3-2-stable` releases have been security fixes, however there hasn't been a non-security release of `3-2-stable` for some months now.\r\n\r\nI'd be really grateful if there could be a non-security release of 3-2-stable - the Mocha deprecation warnings are causing a lot of confusion.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f52fbd3543c15100ab89"}, "issue_id": 8200, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13902477", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8200#issuecomment-13902477", "updated_at": "2013-02-21T17:46:02Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper", "login": "floehopper", "gravatar_id": "f1c2a5fff725fde524bb84503528bd1e", "html_url": "https://github.com/floehopper", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f1c2a5fff725fde524bb84503528bd1e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7a98af17e63a0ac09ce2e96d03992fbc.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3169, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-21T17:46:02Z", "id": 13902477, "owner": "rails"}
