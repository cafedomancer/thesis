Though I think for clarity sake that this could be tidied up for a future release.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see some opinions of a few other rails devs on our differing ideas of how the logic should go. I'm happy to write a patch for my logic if you think that would be the best way to present the alternatives.\r\n\r\nCheers.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383942bd3543c15101009f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3225#issuecomment-2307930"}
