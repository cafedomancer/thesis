I'm not convinced we should ever swallow these exceptions though. When would we want to get a string of bad YAML back instead of being told our object is invalid? That seems surprising. \r\n\r\nIf we want to keep swallowing some errors, it might be nice to create another custom error class that gives the missing class name and suggests that the user require_dependency it. I'm happy to do that if there is interest.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e513bd3543c151009316"}, "issue_id": 9975, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/15594419", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9975#issuecomment-15594419", "updated_at": "2013-03-28T15:22:43Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mmangino/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mmangino/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mmangino/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mmangino/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mmangino", "login": "mmangino", "gravatar_id": "ef55fb706527b4c73a772d024054d3a8", "html_url": "https://github.com/mmangino", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mmangino/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mmangino/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mmangino/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ef55fb706527b4c73a772d024054d3a8?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fdfcebbaf79842c2e6fca7b77741de3a6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mmangino/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 12206, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mmangino/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-28T15:22:43Z", "id": 15594419, "owner": "rails"}
