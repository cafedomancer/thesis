I didn't splash it before because I was checking another issue.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nassert_template(foo: \"bar\") # it isn't raising anything and \"passes\"\r\nassert_template(leiaute: \"test\") # misspelled option\r\n```\r\n\r\n`assert_template` is only handling the keys locals, partial or layout, anything else never fails or passes, giving false positives. We could call `assert_valid_keys` to check them:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nwhen Hash\r\n        options.assert_valid_keys(:layout, :partial, :locals)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are ok with that, then I'm gonna create another pull request.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f45ebd3543c15100aa08"}, "issue_id": 8302, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10701494", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8302#issuecomment-10701494", "updated_at": "2012-11-26T01:03:19Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roberto/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roberto/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roberto/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roberto/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/roberto", "login": "roberto", "gravatar_id": "144d33eb4d11754ac56544bd5501f0f3", "html_url": "https://github.com/roberto", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roberto/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roberto/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roberto/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/144d33eb4d11754ac56544bd5501f0f3?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc76db12c821b79a91d361a4c705ce6b4.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roberto/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4188, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/roberto/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-26T01:03:19Z", "id": 10701494, "owner": "rails"}
