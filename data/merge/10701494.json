I didn't splash it before because I was checking another issue.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nassert_template(foo: \"bar\") # it isn't raising anything and \"passes\"\r\nassert_template(leiaute: \"test\") # misspelled option\r\n```\r\n\r\n`assert_template` is only handling the keys locals, partial or layout, anything else never fails or passes, giving false positives. We could call `assert_valid_keys` to check them:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nwhen Hash\r\n        options.assert_valid_keys(:layout, :partial, :locals)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are ok with that, then I'm gonna create another pull request.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f45ebd3543c15100aa08"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8302#issuecomment-10701494"}
