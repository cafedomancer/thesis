It won't wipe out the order, grouping, etc when the relation is merged. So `post.comments.except(:order)` will still have an order if it comes from a default_scope on Comment. Example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n>> t.comments.except(:order).to_sql\r\n=> \"SELECT `comments`.* FROM `comments`  WHERE `comments`.`trashed` = 0 AND `comments`.`commentable_id` = 223304243 AND `comments`.`commentable_type` = 'Todo' ORDER BY created_at\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps `#except` should take on this larger role, but it'd need deeper consideration.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d4368bd354364b9005c90"}, "issue_id": 9200, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13266590", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9200#issuecomment-13266590", "updated_at": "2013-02-07T22:44:18Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy", "login": "jeremy", "gravatar_id": "24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremy", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84d9ee44e457ddef7f2c4f25dc8fa865.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 199, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-07T22:44:18Z", "id": 13266590, "owner": "rails"}
