Problem with `#except` is that it affects that relation's values only. It won't wipe out the order, grouping, etc when the relation is merged. So `post.comments.except(:order)` will still have an order if it comes from a default_scope on Comment. Example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n>> t.comments.except(:order).to_sql\r\n=> \"SELECT `comments`.* FROM `comments`  WHERE `comments`.`trashed` = 0 AND `comments`.`commentable_id` = 223304243 AND `comments`.`commentable_type` = 'Todo' ORDER BY created_at\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps `#except` should take on this larger role, but it'd need deeper consideration.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d4368bd354364b9005c90"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9200#issuecomment-13266590"}
