{"body": "Good point @al2o3cr. Problem with `#except` is that it affects that relation's values only. It won't wipe out the order, grouping, etc when the relation is merged. So `post.comments.except(:order)` will still have an order if it comes from a default_scope on Comment. Example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n>> t.comments.except(:order).to_sql\r\n=> \"SELECT `comments`.* FROM `comments`  WHERE `comments`.`trashed` = 0 AND `comments`.`commentable_id` = 223304243 AND `comments`.`commentable_type` = 'Todo' ORDER BY created_at\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps `#except` should take on this larger role, but it'd need deeper consideration.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13266590", "created_at": "2013-02-07T22:44:18Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9200#issuecomment-13266590", "updated_at": "2013-02-07T22:44:18Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9200, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremy", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84d9ee44e457ddef7f2c4f25dc8fa865.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/received_events", "gravatar_id": "24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jeremy", "type": "User", "id": 199, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523d4368bd354364b9005c90"}, "id": 13266590, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9200"}
