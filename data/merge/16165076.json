CWD is not required to be `Rails.root`. That's why we are finding `exe` in parent directories. My point is, i have changed the return value of `find_executable_in_parent_path` to return absolute path of `rails executable`. So it doesn't matter whether you are in `app/` or `app/models` or `test/`\r\nSo i think there is no need to `chdir`, as we have absolute path to `rails exe` already!\r\nSorry for the confusion.", "_id": {"$oid": "523cf300bd354364b9003732"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10157#issuecomment-16165076"}
