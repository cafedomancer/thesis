{"body": "Yes. CWD is not required to be `Rails.root`. That's why we are finding `exe` in parent directories.

So it doesn't matter whether you are in `app/` or `app/models` or `test/`\r\nSo i think there is no need to `chdir`, as we have absolute path to `rails exe` already!\r\nSorry for the confusion.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16165076", "created_at": "2013-04-10T09:56:30Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10157#issuecomment-16165076", "updated_at": "2013-04-10T09:56:30Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 10157, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/prathamesh-sonpatki/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/prathamesh-sonpatki/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/prathamesh-sonpatki/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/prathamesh-sonpatki", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/prathamesh-sonpatki/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/prathamesh-sonpatki", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/prathamesh-sonpatki/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1b0973b64704738dbc8ce24d8382bb1f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F10a7864f54092aa82b4a41d2f0ec370c.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/prathamesh-sonpatki/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/prathamesh-sonpatki/received_events", "gravatar_id": "1b0973b64704738dbc8ce24d8382bb1f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/prathamesh-sonpatki/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "prathamesh-sonpatki", "type": "User", "id": 621238, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/prathamesh-sonpatki/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523cf300bd354364b9003732"}, "id": 16165076, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10157"}
