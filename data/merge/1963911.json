Unless I am missing something, this is not something that should ever be switched off in production.\r\n\r\n:-)\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that you will have far-future headers set for files compiled to /assets. If you do not have digests on then it is impossible to get remote clients to refetch the assets. If you precompile without digests then you should not have far-future headers set, which kind of negates the whole point of the feature, IMHO.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383fdfbd3543c15101078f"}, "issue_id": 2782, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1963911", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2782#issuecomment-1963911", "updated_at": "2011-09-01T01:08:01Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse", "login": "rhulse", "gravatar_id": "1c440e1b4de59c602067ff603e74b4e7", "html_url": "https://github.com/rhulse", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1c440e1b4de59c602067ff603e74b4e7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe517564e98c2825803fdf00b6c0d9ee7.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 30732, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rhulse/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-09-01T01:08:01Z", "id": 1963911, "owner": "rails"}
