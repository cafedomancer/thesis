{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3174", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks for the pull request. Could we improve the test here? The current test is calling a private method but i believe we should be testing the real behavior that causes the failure. For example, the test should probably 1) create a cache store 2) cache something in it 3) call delete_matched to remove the directory 4) try to lookup for something and ensure an exception won't be raised. Otherwise, someone can refactor the code later, realize that the coupled test to the method does not makes sense anymore while the bug still exists.", "_id": {"$oid": "523839d3bd3543c151010129"}, "issue_id": 3174, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2248348", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3174#issuecomment-2248348", "updated_at": "2011-09-30T10:49:38Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-09-30T10:49:38Z", "id": 2248348, "owner": "rails"}
