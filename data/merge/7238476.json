{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3023", "repo": "rails", "body": "@brendon I have a similar STI use case as you, but the current state of `becomes` feels pretty neglected and probably belongs in [ActiveRecord::Inheritance](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/inheritance.rb)\n\nI'd rather see a method where I don't have to specify the parent class. The only time I've ever used `becomes` has been in views, and I pass in the parent class every time. Maybe I'm missing something, but why would you want it to become something other than its parent?\n\nSomething like this would be more useful for me:\n\n```ruby\nclass Parent < ActiveRecord::Base; end\nclass Child < Parent; end\n\nchild = Child.new\n```\n\n```erb\n<%= form_for child.to_sti_parent do %>\n<% end %>\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "523f90c1bd354364b9018da7"}, "issue_id": 3023, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7238476", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3023#issuecomment-7238476", "updated_at": "2012-07-25T01:40:49Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/beerlington/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/beerlington/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/beerlington/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/beerlington/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/beerlington", "login": "beerlington", "gravatar_id": "45b75f9f866d240362c0d7fa125025ba", "html_url": "https://github.com/beerlington", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/beerlington/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/beerlington/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/beerlington/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/45b75f9f866d240362c0d7fa125025ba?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F75a8415011978d373d5ce689611a62cc.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/beerlington/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 77580, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/beerlington/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-25T01:40:49Z", "id": 7238476, "owner": "rails"}
