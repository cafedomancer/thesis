I am just adding this as general information as I don't think this particular problem could be easily solved.\r\n\r\n3) We should also update the --help message for the rails new generator to mention the possibility of adding a ~/.railsrc and mention that ~/.railsrc does not affect the values shown in the --help message (the issue 2 cited above).", "_id": {"$oid": "52384242bd3543c151010aca"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2583#issuecomment-2253860"}
