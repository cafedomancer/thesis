That said, I think we should print a message that says \"Using CONTENT from PATH/TO/.RAILSRC\".\r\n\r\n2) If I add --skip-bundler to .railsrc, rails new --help will still show me the default with bundler true. I am just adding this as general information as I don't think this particular problem could be easily solved.\r\n\r\n3) We should also update the --help message for the rails new generator to mention the possibility of adding a ~/.railsrc and mention that ~/.railsrc does not affect the values shown in the --help message (the issue 2 cited above).", "_id": {"$oid": "52384242bd3543c151010aca"}, "issue_id": 2583, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2253860", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2583#issuecomment-2253860", "updated_at": "2011-09-30T20:55:49Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-09-30T20:55:49Z", "id": 2253860, "owner": "rails"}
