In an EC2+ELB environment that header is effectively garbage and should be ignored (ELB only uses X-Forwarded-For, not Client-IP). The fact that it is used to try to detect spoofing results in [legitimate users getting locked out](http://writeheavy.com/2011/07/31/when-its-ok-to-turn-of-rails-ip-spoof-checking.html).
