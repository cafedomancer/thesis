I find that providing the complete table and even adjust it for different platforms is to much. Also the message would need more maintenance and can easily get outdated. I favor a more vague version.\r\n\r\nWhat I find interesting is the two error scenarios you mentioned. I experimented a bit and noticed that when the adapter is found a `Gem::LoadError` is raised in place of the `LoadError`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#<Gem::LoadError: mysql2 is not part of the bundle. Add it to Gemfile.>\r\n#<Gem::LoadError: pg is not part of the bundle. Add it to Gemfile.>\r\n#<Gem::LoadError: sqlite3 is not part of the bundle. Add it to Gemfile.>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current version detects the error scenario and displays the accurate error message (the wording could probably be improved).\r\n\r\n@fxn What do you think?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f644bd3543c15100ade2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8060#issuecomment-9881523"}
