Kindly guide. Once this is clear, then the skipping of test_framework will be clear too.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52386091bd3543c15101228c"}, "issue_id": 414, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1111228", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/414#issuecomment-1111228", "updated_at": "2011-05-06T13:20:22Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi", "login": "asanghi", "gravatar_id": "f4ba063457702c78a7fce6a3529aedb0", "html_url": "https://github.com/asanghi", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f4ba063457702c78a7fce6a3529aedb0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F06997f04a7db92466a2baa6ebc8b872d.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 762, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asanghi/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-06T13:20:22Z", "id": 1111228, "owner": "rails"}
