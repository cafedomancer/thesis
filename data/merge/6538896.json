{"body": "When I originally made the PR it occurred to me that we could make the necessary SQLite function calls to support Time. As @tenderlove points out in #6835 it is already done for other column types in SQLite. But it seemed to me that it would be a complicated endeavor as Time related things can be.\n\n@pixeltrix Would it be better to build this functionality into Rails or issue a warning and allow the developer to make the necessary adjustments to queries to use the SQLite date/time functions? If you want to bake this support into Rails I'd be happy to help, though I may need a bit of guidance.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6538896", "created_at": "2012-06-25T03:02:43Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6344#issuecomment-6538896", "updated_at": "2012-06-25T03:02:43Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6344, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erichmenge/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erichmenge/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erichmenge/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/erichmenge", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erichmenge/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/erichmenge", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erichmenge/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/d309ddb80e1e28e6f8e3a9685d1f8b29?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F54ffc15ef26ae3d74868acd1923d76e0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erichmenge/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erichmenge/received_events", "gravatar_id": "d309ddb80e1e28e6f8e3a9685d1f8b29", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erichmenge/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "erichmenge", "type": "User", "id": 552146, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/erichmenge/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380aabbd3543c15100cf46"}, "id": 6538896, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6344"}
