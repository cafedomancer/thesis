As @tenderlove points out in #6835 it is already done for other column types in SQLite. But it seemed to me that it would be a complicated endeavor as Time related things can be.\n\n@pixeltrix Would it be better to build this functionality into Rails or issue a warning and allow the developer to make the necessary adjustments to queries to use the SQLite date/time functions? If you want to bake this support into Rails I'd be happy to help, though I may need a bit of guidance.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380aabbd3543c15100cf46"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6344#issuecomment-6538896"}
