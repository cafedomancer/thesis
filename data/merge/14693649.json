We decided not to load all the fixtures by default if you run single test. I think the intention is that you will want to load only fixtures you want explicitly in the test file.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you run the whole suite, `rails test` will load the fixtures for you like it used to be.\r\n\r\nRegarding the support for only one file name: is that really the case? I think I have a [test case to cover running multiple files](https://github.com/sikachu/rails/commit/b4df25366a3c8f133f8329bc35f1d53926704b5a#L3R35).
