Database tables are unordered lists.\r\n2. `first` and `last` are not behaving consistently.\r\n\r\nThen it seems reasonable to me to make this conclusion:\r\n\r\n`last` should not order by PK.\r\n\r\nIf that's true then why should we create a bunch of new methods? I think the issue is with `last` not `first`. Both of these methods make sense when you have an ordered list.\r\n\r\nUsing something like `single` or `one` indicates nothing about the position of the element. And `limit` already exists, adding another method named `take` does not seem to resolve the issue.", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138d8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4644548"}
