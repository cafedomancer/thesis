{"body": "If we assume:\r\n\r\n1. Database tables are unordered lists.\r\n2. `first` and `last` are not behaving consistently.\r\n\r\nThen it seems reasonable to me to make this conclusion:\r\n\r\n`last` should not order by PK.\r\n\r\nIf that's true then why should we create a bunch of new methods? I think the issue is with `last` not `first`. Both of these methods make sense when you have an ordered list.\r\n\r\nUsing something like `single` or `one` indicates nothing about the position of the element. And `limit` already exists, adding another method named `take` does not seem to resolve the issue.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4644548", "created_at": "2012-03-22T18:01:11Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4644548", "updated_at": "2012-03-22T18:01:11Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5153, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/panthomakos", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/22a9bb6a9ec077e4d666d98052790c05?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd11f0caf58f8bf7c3bdedb631acfaa64.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/received_events", "gravatar_id": "22a9bb6a9ec077e4d666d98052790c05", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "panthomakos", "type": "User", "id": 186424, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/panthomakos/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138d8"}, "id": 4644548, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5153"}
