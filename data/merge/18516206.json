It's a potential blocker for release. Perhaps it's worth considering making this a breaking change in the upgrade from 3.x?\r\n\r\nI'll dig some more to see if I can fix the issue, but I'm not 100% sure how to proceed. If we see a PUT route with no conflicting PATCH route, should we make one? (I haven't thought through all of the potential areas of conflict yet.)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dbffbd3543c151008937"}, "issue_id": 10747, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18516206", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10747#issuecomment-18516206", "updated_at": "2013-05-27T22:00:47Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk", "login": "trevorturk", "gravatar_id": "c0b6fb3807d7d4f255463ed168c75897", "html_url": "https://github.com/trevorturk", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/c0b6fb3807d7d4f255463ed168c75897?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F69cb3ea317a32c4e6143e665fdb20b14.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-27T22:00:47Z", "id": 18516206, "owner": "rails"}
