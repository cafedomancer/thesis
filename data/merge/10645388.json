If you trust your proxy server(s), and by trust I also mean you trust them to handle `X-Forwarded-For` appropriately (and barring any vulnerabilities those might have). Then you should be able to trust a *portion* of the header's content, which should produce the IP address of the device connected to your outer-most trusted proxy.\r\n\r\nIf you don't use *any* (trusted) proxy servers, then you should simply ignore the `X-Forwarded-For` header *completely*.", "_id": {"$oid": "523db5b8bd354364b90095e5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7980#issuecomment-10645388"}
