{"body": "@NZKoz I just re-read your comment:\r\n\r\n> while we read from X-Forwarded-For in the implementation of remote_ip then you'll always be potentially vulnerable to spoofing attacks\r\n\r\nThis is not entirely accurate. If you trust your proxy server(s), and by trust I also mean you trust them to handle `X-Forwarded-For` appropriately (and barring any vulnerabilities those might have). Then you should be able to trust a *portion* of the header's content, which should produce the IP address of the device connected to your outer-most trusted proxy.\r\n\r\nIf you don't use *any* (trusted) proxy servers, then you should simply ignore the `X-Forwarded-For` header *completely*.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10645388", "created_at": "2012-11-22T21:28:23Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7980#issuecomment-10645388", "updated_at": "2012-11-22T21:28:23Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7980, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gingerlime/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gingerlime/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gingerlime/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gingerlime", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gingerlime/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/gingerlime", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gingerlime/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/00afd84dac05c525b368b3f9beafc8fb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4ac1fa9b1685190560b880b9ee5993bb.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gingerlime/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gingerlime/received_events", "gravatar_id": "00afd84dac05c525b368b3f9beafc8fb", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gingerlime/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "gingerlime", "type": "User", "id": 524274, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gingerlime/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523db5b8bd354364b90095e5"}, "id": 10645388, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7980"}
