{"body": "@steveklabnik @tenderlove With all due respect, this is a terrible rationale. Not only is backporting/reverting rare, but `git revert` and `git cherry-pick` accept ranges of commits.\r\n\r\nSquashing is lossy, the commits I'm submitting are atomic and make it easier to understand what's going on, for example if anyone does a git blame at some point.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you decide to revert part of this (e.g. make drop_table revertible), you won't be able to if the commits are squashed. Similarly, the first commits are simple code improvements made because I noticed things while doing my changes.\r\n\r\nThese commits total over 1000 line changes in total, I don't see a problem in them being split in a bunch of atomic commits.\r\n\r\nIf you want me to open 13 different pull requests, I will, or maybe the commit messages should refer to this PR, but I won't squash these commits.
