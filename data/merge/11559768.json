Not only is backporting/reverting rare, but `git revert` and `git cherry-pick` accept ranges of commits.\r\n\r\nSquashing is lossy, the commits I'm submitting are atomic and make it easier to understand what's going on, for example if anyone does a git blame at some point.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you decide to revert part of this (e.g. make drop_table revertible), you won't be able to if the commits are squashed. Similarly, the first commits are simple code improvements made because I noticed things while doing my changes.\r\n\r\nThese commits total over 1000 line changes in total, I don't see a problem in them being split in a bunch of atomic commits.\r\n\r\nIf you want me to open 13 different pull requests, I will, or maybe the commit messages should refer to this PR, but I won't squash these commits. Of course, you guys are free to do it yourself if you feel that's the way it should be.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d9f62bd354364b9008628"}, "issue_id": 8267, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11559768", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8267#issuecomment-11559768", "updated_at": "2012-12-20T04:08:13Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre", "login": "marcandre", "gravatar_id": "b06d8e26b92456b228d3c77b66397534", "html_url": "https://github.com/marcandre", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b06d8e26b92456b228d3c77b66397534?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b48ea597d2862688e4aa8a2b28651a3.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 33770, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-20T04:08:13Z", "id": 11559768, "owner": "rails"}
