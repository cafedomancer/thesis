The main idea is \"this is my opinion and the only authorities for me are myself and Matz, not you, \"dudes\".\r\n\r\n> What people should expect with Ruby is to not expect the true and false singletons from predicate methods.\r\n\r\nWell, it differs from what people *do* expect. Most predicates return booleans in ruby and rails. People got used to it. One *should not* do something different without really good reason. And sorry, but there's no good reason here.
