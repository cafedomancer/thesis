I suspected same join record is being initialized 3 times, but apparently that is not the case. It is just validations are being triggered 3 times.\r\n\r\nI still do not understand why it is not okay to have join record being created via autosave_assocations and why this must be done explicitly. \r\n\r\nAs for #8269 yes, I have gone through. I as well hope, either @tenderlove or @jonleighton comment on this.
