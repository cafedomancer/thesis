It is generated under `app/views/layouts/ENGINE_NAME/application.html.erb`.\r\n\r\nOn a similar note, it would be nice if there was some way to set the asset prefix at the engine config level just like we do with `isolate_namespace`. Then if we have `<%= image_tag \"foo.png\" %>` it would expand to `/assets/ENGINE_NAME/foo.png`. It looks like there's a `config.assets.prefix` setting in Rails itself, but it doesn't look like this is exposed to the engine railtie.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385175bd3543c151011790"}, "issue_id": 1672, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1357463", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1672#issuecomment-1357463", "updated_at": "2011-06-13T07:39:45Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb", "login": "ryanb", "gravatar_id": "8dbf316d36ff66aad4869a4fc3cfbd37", "html_url": "https://github.com/ryanb", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8dbf316d36ff66aad4869a4fc3cfbd37?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbd4c9ab730f5513206b999ec0d90d1fb.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 161, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-13T07:39:45Z", "id": 1357463, "owner": "rails"}
