It is generated under `app/views/layouts/ENGINE_NAME/application.html.erb`.\r\n\r\nOn a similar note, it would be nice if there was some way to set the asset prefix at the engine config level just like we do with `isolate_namespace`. Then if we have `<%= image_tag \"foo.png\" %>` it would expand to `/assets/ENGINE_NAME/foo.png`. It looks like there's a `config.assets.prefix` setting in Rails itself, but it doesn't look like this is exposed to the engine railtie.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385175bd3543c151011790"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1672#issuecomment-1357463"}
