Could also be worth clarifying `original_url`?\r\n\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e75abd3543c151009570"}, "issue_id": 9698, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14873011", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9698#issuecomment-14873011", "updated_at": "2013-03-13T22:33:47Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garethrees/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garethrees/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garethrees/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garethrees/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/garethrees", "login": "garethrees", "gravatar_id": "dae1370d5e7a9872ba303da4669a74a9", "html_url": "https://github.com/garethrees", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garethrees/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garethrees/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garethrees/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/dae1370d5e7a9872ba303da4669a74a9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F229702ae1cb086e5a6900288d6c3d92d.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garethrees/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 282788, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garethrees/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-13T22:33:47Z", "id": 14873011, "owner": "rails"}
