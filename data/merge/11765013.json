{"body": "the Pull Requests on github are reflect the contents of your branch. This means, you can put whatever you want on the branch you created the PR from and it will be updated to reflect that content. For your situation you should be able to push the squashed commit to the branch like so (involves a force push):\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit push -f <remote-name-for-your-fork> a87cd4d47ccff684a410c3bf6e1ee05506458326:activerecord-structure_dump-ending_nl\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile `<remote-name-for-your-fork>` is almost certainly \"origin\". This will push the commit a87cd4d47ccff684a410c3bf6e1ee05506458326 to the branch \"activerecord-structure_dump-ending_nl\", which is the source of this PR.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11765013", "created_at": "2012-12-30T14:33:39Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8651#issuecomment-11765013", "updated_at": "2012-12-30T14:33:39Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8651, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "senny", "type": "User", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f152bd3543c15100a417"}, "id": 11765013, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8651"}
