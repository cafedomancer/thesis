But I think I've done it. \n\nI _think_ it is creating fairer access to the pool, with less 'stolen' connections -- my average times waiting for checkout are going down. \n\nHowever, I think I've still got a connectionpool _leak_ in my app -- only after it's been under a production load for 20 minutes or so, all the threads start getting exceptions unable to get connections -- my guess is this is _leaked_ connections, rather than a fairness issue. \n\nIf so, hard to say if it's caused by this patch, by other changes to master vs rails 3, or by my own app code (but I've spent a heck of a lot of time with my app code trying to keep it from leaking connections). Or by improperly merging the patch into rails 3.2.3 in my app.  I was not getting quite this behavior (after 20 minutes of production mode, hardly anyone can get a connection) prior to merging in this new implementation. But I have merged it in improperly too, alas. \n\nThis stuff is very hard to debug. \n\nSo, I'm not sure what info this gives, if any. I was hoping to be able to say this patch solved all my problems. ", "_id": {"$oid": "52380779bd3543c15100cabb"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6492#issuecomment-5993763"}
