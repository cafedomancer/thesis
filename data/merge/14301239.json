So in our app we use SQL in our migrations to take advantage of pg's rich datatypes and constraints and every date/time attribute on our models is currently returning a String when we moved to 4beta and of course this made it through because the test assert_equal Time.utc(2010,1,1, 11,0,0), @first_timestamp_with_zone.time will pass with a string value.\r\n\r\nThus the added assert_instance_of will complete the test to ensure equality and type.\r\n\r\nI should probably switch testing the instance for ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone to Time begin the assert_equal has the value covered...", "_id": {"$oid": "523d27a3bd354364b90052fa"}, "issue_id": 9431, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14301239", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9431#issuecomment-14301239", "updated_at": "2013-03-01T17:36:01Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/troyk/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/troyk/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/troyk/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/troyk/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/troyk", "login": "troyk", "gravatar_id": "382c035a12292d8dfa44ee531cbbfb33", "html_url": "https://github.com/troyk", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/troyk/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/troyk/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/troyk/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/382c035a12292d8dfa44ee531cbbfb33?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F088d6dc6ddb3113e9b902711ccdfafef.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/troyk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 13517, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/troyk/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-01T17:36:01Z", "id": 14301239, "owner": "rails"}
