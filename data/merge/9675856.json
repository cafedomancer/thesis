So I think we should keep it. Since the option is already scoped to the remote IP middleware, and applies to more than one header, I would suggest naming it \"first_ip\" or \"first_client_ip\".\r\n\r\nOn Oct 22, 2012, at 11:09 AM, Alexey Gaziev <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> So, I'm ready to push some commits.

We should give him only first or last ip from list as we decided here. I changed code in remote_ip.rb and fix tests for it.
