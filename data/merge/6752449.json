I use 100000 generally, but 16384 would be not bad at this moment. The key point is enough slowness and it depends on purposes.\n* salt: should have enough entropy. Length check would be good to have. 16 bytes or more?\n* derived key length: should be specified by caller b/c it depends on purpose. SHA1 length (160bit) would be good if you need a default.\n* Something#derive_key interface should have at least a parameter \"salt\". Just in case it's not a typo.\n\n@emboss should confirm my thoughts. :)\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380195bd3543c15100c16d"}, "issue_id": 6952, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6752449", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6952#issuecomment-6752449", "updated_at": "2012-07-04T04:39:11Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nahi/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nahi/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nahi/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nahi/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nahi", "login": "nahi", "gravatar_id": "6c06915d9aa00cd5c7d4acfb27cdd4e9", "html_url": "https://github.com/nahi", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nahi/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nahi/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nahi/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6c06915d9aa00cd5c7d4acfb27cdd4e9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fcaea84e7e50ea556a7cd84ee1d0963a8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 44209, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nahi/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-04T04:39:11Z", "id": 6752449, "owner": "rails"}
