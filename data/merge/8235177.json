Patching away certain features seems odd to me. I see that the model currently is a lot of code for this small bug but if it gets merged I'll rewrite the alternate tests to use the new model instead so we can make sure it actually works.\n\nOf course If you like to have the workarounds in the testing code, I'll drop the models and get it working somehow. Someone with more internal rails knowledge should give me a hint what direction to take.", "_id": {"$oid": "523de65abd354364b900b2de"}, "issue_id": 7506, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8235177", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7506#issuecomment-8235177", "updated_at": "2012-09-03T10:40:55Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "login": "senny", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-03T10:40:55Z", "id": 8235177, "owner": "rails"}
