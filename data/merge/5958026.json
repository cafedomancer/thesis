The core_ext file that monkeypatches ```to_s``` is now named conversions.rb, in order to be consistent with other parts of the AS codebase.\n\nLet me know if you'd like any other changes.  Thanks for all the feedback!\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523e6611bd354364b900fb7c"}, "issue_id": 6315, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5958026", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6315#issuecomment-5958026", "updated_at": "2012-05-28T01:28:40Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz", "login": "amutz", "gravatar_id": "aed424af11b9f92cca6c051f75f013b7", "html_url": "https://github.com/amutz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/aed424af11b9f92cca6c051f75f013b7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F77d85e54bebbad4c976bf8fc0923c567.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 919763, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amutz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-28T01:28:40Z", "id": 5958026, "owner": "rails"}
