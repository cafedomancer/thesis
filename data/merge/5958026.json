{"body": "Ok, I've made the desired changes and squashed and rebased them into a single commit.\n\nPer @josevalim 's request, the methods now reside in ```ActiveSupport::NumberHelper``` and can be accessed via ```Numeric.to_s```  and ```Numeric.to_formatted_s```.  The core_ext file that monkeypatches ```to_s``` is now named conversions.rb, in order to be consistent with other parts of the AS codebase.\n\nLet me know if you'd like any other changes.
