I hadn't considered that until I read your response.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am concerned that checking for all false values in this case might be overreaching.  What if I have a model called \"Amounts\" that does nothing but store dollar amounts where zero is a valid value?  Indiscriminately checking for false values would incorrectly reject the creation of this record.\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned, this is a problem with checkboxes, so I think what we really want to check is:  1) is the value blank   2) is the value false AND the attribute is a boolean field\r\n\r\nHowever, since _destroy does not actually exist on the model, it would also need to ignore this meta field separately.  This really starts to make implementation messy:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n# horrible, horrible pseudo-code -- only being shown as illustration\r\nproc { |attributes| attributes.all? { |key, value| value.blank? || key=='_destroy' || (FALSE_VALUES.include?(value) && boolean_column?(key))} }\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on perusing a simpler implementation that handles 90%+ cases versus just allowing developers to implement their own rejection method?\r\n\r\nI'm willing to submit a patch either way.", "_id": {"$oid": "523f6d0dbd354364b9018014"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3340#issuecomment-2428697"}
