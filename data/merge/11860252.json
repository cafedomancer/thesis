It should behave like any other object that doesn't respond to `to_i`.\r\n\r\nNo it is not clearer or safer, it is error prone. It should not change the original value at all. You are not assigning a valid value, so it should not change the object. I would expect to raise an exception instead of silently changing my value to `nil`.
