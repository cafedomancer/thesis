This problem was driving me crazy until I found your post on the topic. Until this patch is \"officially released\" in an upcoming version of Rails, I'm working around the problem by calling \r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Base.connection.clear_cache! # HACK: Workaround\r\n\r\n...just before setting a new search path.
