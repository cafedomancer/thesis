This problem was driving me crazy until I found your post on the topic. Until this patch is \"officially released\" in an upcoming version of Rails, I'm working around the problem by calling \r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Base.connection.clear_cache! # HACK: Workaround\r\n\r\n...just before setting a new search path. I'm not familiar with the Rails release process, but I hope this fix is included in the next version.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383931bd3543c151010087"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3232#issuecomment-2630780"}
