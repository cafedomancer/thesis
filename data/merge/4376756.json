{"body": "Yep, this should also change the generated applications to have something like\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception, if your application has an API, you'll need to use :reset_session\r\nprotect_from_forgery :with=>:exception\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a more secure default with a tiny change for api developers who need it.  We could also leave the default for existing apps as reset_session but change newly generated apps to include :with=>:exception\r\n\r\n@lest `null_session` is another change we'd discussed,  instead of resetting the session it should just assign the cookie and session objects to values which return null for everything and then send no Set-Cookie headers in the response.\r\n\r\nThat way it's *like* the session has been reset, without actually logging the user out for subsequent requests.  We can address that in another pull request.\r\n\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4376756", "created_at": "2012-03-07T20:36:32Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5326#issuecomment-4376756", "updated_at": "2012-03-07T20:36:32Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5326, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "NZKoz", "type": "User", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523eccd8bd354364b9012ef6"}, "id": 4376756, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5326"}
