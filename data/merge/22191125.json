The `ensure` block is in `compute_and_store_digest`, the `rescue` block (which I thought was also an `ensure`) is on `#digest` (not `.digest`).\r\n\r\nThe `rescue` on `#digest` already captures `ActionView::MissingTemplate`, which I believe is the only error that could be raised by `Digestor`. We could change it to also send that error up the stack to be caught by `compute_and_store_digest`?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d15ebd3543c151007dc3"}, "issue_id": 11768, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/22191125", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11768#issuecomment-22191125", "updated_at": "2013-08-06T16:15:14Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jridgewell/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jridgewell/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jridgewell/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jridgewell/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jridgewell", "login": "jridgewell", "gravatar_id": "830bc5499b0658970c22ebf18d3bb36a", "html_url": "https://github.com/jridgewell", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jridgewell/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jridgewell/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jridgewell/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/830bc5499b0658970c22ebf18d3bb36a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3f098efb170e17387b60f08a6b406dbc.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jridgewell/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 112982, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jridgewell/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-08-06T16:15:14Z", "id": 22191125, "owner": "rails"}
