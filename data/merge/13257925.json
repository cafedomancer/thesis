Ideally every value should be quoted correctly?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean by here.  In the predicate builder it is because Fixnum and Bignum are handled as literals by Arel (https://github.com/rails/arel/blob/master/lib/arel/visitors/to_sql.rb#L557).  The quote method naturally is all special casing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some work can be done on Arel's side to remove the special casing in the predicate builder, specifically to make sure last_column is cleared before reaching actual literal integers like the arguments to LIMIT and OFFSET.  After that it may be able to quote integers safely.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ec25bd3543c151009c4c"}, "issue_id": 9207, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13257925", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9207#issuecomment-13257925", "updated_at": "2013-02-07T20:32:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith", "login": "dylanahsmith", "gravatar_id": "d6af3d9442783aa00ef1e5d7772f997d", "html_url": "https://github.com/dylanahsmith", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d6af3d9442783aa00ef1e5d7772f997d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F95f1d47eb81295ff9866b9f7291894c1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 954402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-07T20:32:04Z", "id": 13257925, "owner": "rails"}
