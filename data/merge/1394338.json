{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1699", "repo": "rails", "body": "In order to minimize risk I have made the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. By default, whenever a request is in scope the `:request` protocol will be used.\r\n2. By default, whenever a request is not in scope (E.g. rake assets:precompile) the `:relative` protocol will be used.\r\n3. When the default protocol is explicitly set to `:request`, asset hosts are disabled whenever a request is not in scope thus effectively disabling this entire pull request.\r\n4. A user can set the default protocol to `:relative` if they want to use relative assets urls even when a request is in scope.\r\n5. Even if the default protocol is `:relative`, the default will be :request for stylesheet link tags to avoid the IE7-8 double download issue. If a user wants to use protocol relative urls for stylesheet link tags, they will need to explicitly set the protocol in their asset host configuration.\r\n\r\nAs before, if a protocol is specified by the asset host, then that is always used.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385126bd3543c151011754"}, "issue_id": 1699, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1394338", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1699#issuecomment-1394338", "updated_at": "2011-06-18T19:35:34Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein", "login": "chriseppstein", "gravatar_id": "723ee972f9e5078aeda85cdf0db3f3c8", "html_url": "https://github.com/chriseppstein", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/723ee972f9e5078aeda85cdf0db3f3c8?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F728f206c2a01bf572b5940d7d9a8fa4c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1839, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-18T19:35:34Z", "id": 1394338, "owner": "rails"}
