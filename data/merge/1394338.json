By default, whenever a request is in scope the `:request` protocol will be used.\r\n2. By default, whenever a request is not in scope (E.g. rake assets:precompile) the `:relative` protocol will be used.\r\n3. When the default protocol is explicitly set to `:request`, asset hosts are disabled whenever a request is not in scope thus effectively disabling this entire pull request.\r\n4. A user can set the default protocol to `:relative` if they want to use relative assets urls even when a request is in scope.\r\n5. Even if the default protocol is `:relative`, the default will be :request for stylesheet link tags to avoid the IE7-8 double download issue. If a user wants to use protocol relative urls for stylesheet link tags, they will need to explicitly set the protocol in their asset host configuration.\r\n\r\nAs before, if a protocol is specified by the asset host, then that is always used.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385126bd3543c151011754"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1699#issuecomment-1394338"}
