{"body": "This doesn't fix the problem completely as according to [RFC 3986][1] sub-delims are allow unescaped within a path segment:\r\n\r\n    # from page 12\r\n    sub-delims  = \"!\" / \"$\" / \"&\" / \"'\" / \"(\" / \")\"\r\n                  / \"*\" / \"+\" / \",\" / \";\" / \"=\"\r\n\r\n    # from page 22\r\n    pchar         = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / \":\" / \"@\"\r\n\r\nThe real problem is [here][2] and [here][3] \u2013 `Rack::Utils.unescape` is treating it like form data. What we should use is `URI::Parser.unescape` with a regexp for the appropriate characters. It needs to be fixed both here and in `Rack::File` as that performs a `File.file?` check as well. Do you want me to create a pull request for Rack? Also should it be backported previous versions of Rails and Rack?\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt\r\n[2]: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/static.rb#L14\r\n[3]: https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/file.rb#L40\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4017925", "created_at": "2012-02-17T10:14:48Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5066#issuecomment-4017925", "updated_at": "2012-02-17T10:14:48Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5066, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "pixeltrix", "type": "User", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52381d40bd3543c15100e596"}, "id": 4017925, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5066"}
