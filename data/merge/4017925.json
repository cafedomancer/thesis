What we should use is `URI::Parser.unescape` with a regexp for the appropriate characters. It needs to be fixed both here and in `Rack::File` as that performs a `File.file?` check as well. Do you want me to create a pull request for Rack? Also should it be backported previous versions of Rails and Rack?\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt\r\n[2]: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/static.rb#L14\r\n[3]: https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/file.rb#L40\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52381d40bd3543c15100e596"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5066#issuecomment-4017925"}
