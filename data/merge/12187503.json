{"body": "Apologies for the late comment, but a couple thoughts on this:\r\n\r\n* the dummy class is spelled wrong. Minor, but bugs the heck outta me (`FakeAssociatonProxy` is missing an `i`).\r\n\r\n* the dummy object means that the behavior for *real* `CollectionProxy` objects is untested. For instance, if they stopped responding to `to_ary`, the tests would still pass despite the bug having reappeared.\r\n\r\n* the underlying change (`is_a?(Array)` no longer true for collection proxies) is going to break other people's code - maybe add a CHANGELOG entry for it?\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12187503", "created_at": "2013-01-13T00:34:20Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8623#issuecomment-12187503", "updated_at": "2013-01-13T00:34:20Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8623, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/al2o3cr", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb20bb95ab626d93fd976af958fbc61ba.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/received_events", "gravatar_id": "6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "al2o3cr", "type": "User", "id": 1191, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523d7b1cbd354364b90072d6"}, "id": 12187503, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8623"}
