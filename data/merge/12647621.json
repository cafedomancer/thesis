What I'd like to achieve, is being able to easily use the default subject I18n structure, but with interpolation. Even if `mailer_scope` were a method, I'd still need to join it with action_name and \".subject\", so it's not as elegant.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that this is a tiny improvement, so if your call is that it's not worth the costs, I'm totally fine with that.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about allowing the `:subject` option to be a Hash, and if it is, treat it as interpolations for the default I18n subject?", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5bedbd354364b90061b4"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9046#issuecomment-12647621"}
