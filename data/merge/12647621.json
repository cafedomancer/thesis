{"body": "@carlosantoniodasilva well, sort of. What I'd like to achieve, is being able to easily use the default subject I18n structure, but with interpolation. Even if `mailer_scope` were a method, I'd still need to join it with action_name and \".subject\", so it's not as elegant.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that this is a tiny improvement, so if your call is that it's not worth the costs, I'm totally fine with that.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about allowing the `:subject` option to be a Hash, and if it is, treat it as interpolations for the default I18n subject?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12647621", "created_at": "2013-01-24T11:42:29Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9046#issuecomment-12647621", "updated_at": "2013-01-24T11:42:29Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9046, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/exviva", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/56c0f984e7a1cccbd5ea165ef310ba4f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa77d299ee00dfee2de17de8fcd02c69a.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/received_events", "gravatar_id": "56c0f984e7a1cccbd5ea165ef310ba4f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "exviva", "type": "User", "id": 80070, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523d5bedbd354364b90061b4"}, "id": 12647621, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9046"}
