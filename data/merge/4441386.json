{"body": "Thanks again for the feedback @josevalim! I agree that before_filter and after_filter would be appropriate here, and including AbstractController::Callbacks seems to be working perfectly.  I've added tests for `before_filter` and `after_filter` in ActionMailer, and they pass after including AbstractController::Callbacks in ActionMailer::Base.  \r\n\r\nI also added documentation that describes how to use these filters, and indicates that the user should prefer `before_filter` to `after_filter` to assure proper parsing of headers.\r\n\r\nI realize that the three tests I added may be redundant, since I assume that filters are tested well in AbstractController::Callbacks, however I thought they served a purpose in documenting how these callbacks can be used in ActionMailer.  Let me know, though, if you think they should be removed.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4441386", "created_at": "2012-03-11T19:21:27Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5372#issuecomment-4441386", "updated_at": "2012-03-11T19:21:27Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5372, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsl/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsl/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsl/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsl", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsl/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsl", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsl/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/c3dce717fc1f2915c5cd966680b7f1f7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe3a72c791a69f87b05ea7742e04430ed.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsl/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsl/received_events", "gravatar_id": "c3dce717fc1f2915c5cd966680b7f1f7", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsl/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jsl", "type": "User", "id": 9977, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsl/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52381923bd3543c15100e150"}, "id": 4441386, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5372"}
