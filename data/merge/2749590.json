This shortcut works when you just want to access the instance variable.  If you wanted to do more, say cast the value on the way out, you would just skip the shortcut and define the method normally.  It doesn't make sense to have Ruby define the wrong version and you override it in the same class definition.\r\n\r\nNow, the code Josh changed is a different scenario.  Rails is giving you ways to describe your schema.  It will then use that description to build the needed interface methods.  It does make perfect sense that you could then need to override those, adding additional behavior to the raw database access Rails is providing.\r\n\r\nThat's why this change from Josh is such a great idea.  I'm all for it.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523f5c6ebd354364b901742b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3636#issuecomment-2749590"}
