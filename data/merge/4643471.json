{"body": "I'm against adding an order to `first`.  We might be able to overcome these issues, but I feel like I need to list them off before we make any changes.\r\n\r\n### 1. Backwards compatibility and deprecation\r\n\r\nHow do we deprecate this behavior and remain backwards compatible?  Presumably PG users that use this feature may depend on it's current behavior.\r\n\r\n### 2. What should we order by?\r\n\r\nPrimary key doesn't necessarily indicate which record was the first to be added.  Some replicating / sharding databases chunk up their primary keys (and in fact we have one at work).  We could sort by `created_at` columns, but those might not be present.\r\n\r\nTo be frank, a database table seems like an unordered list to me.  It doesn't surprise me that asking for `first` without specifying how you want the list to be sorted will return an unpredictable answer.\r\n\r\nMaybe the best solution would be:\r\n\r\n1. Add a warning if first is called without an order\r\n2. Add a `take` method for people that use `first` as `take(1)`\r\n\r\nThoughts?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4643471", "created_at": "2012-03-22T17:14:45Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5153#issuecomment-4643471", "updated_at": "2012-03-22T17:14:45Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5153, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tenderlove", "type": "User", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ee96cbd354364b90138d2"}, "id": 4643471, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5153"}
