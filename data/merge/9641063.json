The guide is already very polished, and we have time for those final details before Rails 4, so let's merge.\r\n\r\nI'll also write a guides changelog entry.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot Steve! :heart:", "_id": {"$oid": "523de79dbd354364b900b3c8"}, "issue_id": 7493, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9641063", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7493#issuecomment-9641063", "updated_at": "2012-10-21T09:32:25Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-21T09:32:25Z", "id": 9641063, "owner": "rails"}
