The guide is already very polished, and we have time for those final details before Rails 4, so let's merge.\r\n\r\nI'll also write a guides changelog entry.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot Steve! :heart:", "_id": {"$oid": "523de79dbd354364b900b3c8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7493#issuecomment-9641063"}
