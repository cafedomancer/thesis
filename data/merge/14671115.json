It seems like it might not be immediately apparent that all requests to a controller using Live are streamed, even if you're just `render`ing a view as normal. Do you think it would make sense to only stream when stream.write is called directly from the controller, or if stream: true is passed to render? If not, we should probable change the wording in the documentation from \"all actions in that controller will be able to stream\" to \"all actions will stream\"", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1a9dbd354364b9004aa9"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9604#issuecomment-14671115"}
