{"body": "This change has the downside of creating a block scope in that method that would not otherwise exist - e.g.:\r\n\r\n    some_variable = \"defined\"\r\n    define_method :my_method do\r\n      puts some_variable # prints \"defined\" when called\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    class_eval <<-EOV, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1\r\n      def my_method\r\n        puts some_variable # no method error when called\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThis may or may not have performance implications depending on where and how often these methods are called. I think the define_method way is cleaner, but scope switching has bitten me before.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13250177", "created_at": "2013-02-07T17:53:00Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9206#issuecomment-13250177", "updated_at": "2013-02-07T17:53:31Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9206, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaggederest/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaggederest/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaggederest/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaggederest", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaggederest/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jaggederest", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaggederest/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/69c54cc530fa953e144771c03eccc5a9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff11bec1411101c743f64df596773d0b2.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaggederest/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaggederest/received_events", "gravatar_id": "69c54cc530fa953e144771c03eccc5a9", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaggederest/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jaggederest", "type": "User", "id": 3559, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaggederest/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523d42ddbd354364b9005c23"}, "id": 13250177, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9206"}
