{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6492", "repo": "rails", "body": "I'm not sure if this is helpful or not, but I added some logging to my patched 3.2.3 app based on your implementation. \n\nIn `acquire_connection`, if it gets to the `else` branch (could not immediately check out without waiting), I log the num_waiting and the num_available. \n\nI'm sometimes getting log lines that says the num waiting is 0, and the num_available is, say, 8.  Then how did it get to that branch?  The whole thing is in a syncronized block, so it shouldn't have even been able to get to that `else` clause. I'm not really sure what's going on, could certainly be a bug or idiosyncracy of my own code, not yours. Just still trying to use your code in my app to resolve it's problems.
