Then how did it get to that branch?  The whole thing is in a syncronized block, so it shouldn't have even been able to get to that `else` clause. I'm not really sure what's going on, could certainly be a bug or idiosyncracy of my own code, not yours. Just still trying to use your code in my app to resolve it's problems.
