{"body": "@jmileham you can just call `ast` on the select manager.  ARel does not do \"relational algebra\", it merely manages an SQL ast.  Since one ast is a valid subtree of another ast, you *should* be able to pull the ast from one select manager, and pass it to another select manager.\n\nAs for aliasing your subquery, we can construct an `AS` node.  Off the top of my head, you could do something like this:\n\n    as = Arel::Nodes::As.new sm1.grouping(sm1.ast), Arel.sql('omg')\n    sm2.project('whatever').from(as)\n\nProbably we need a factory method for `As` nodes, but I see no reason why Arel cannot handle this use case today.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/910541", "created_at": "2011-03-24T00:41:49Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/201#issuecomment-910541", "updated_at": "2011-03-24T00:43:37Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 201, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tenderlove", "type": "User", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523865dcbd3543c15101274d"}, "id": 910541, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/201"}
