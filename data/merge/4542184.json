It doesn't automatically handle relationships, doesn't let you know what to pass to create to make a new object, requires out-of-band knowledge to use an api correctly, doesn't have a standard way to deal with finders, etc.  All of these things have patches to fix them running out in the wild, but weren't accepted.  Even if/when they were accepted, they had to be tied to the larger release cycle of rails itself.  There have *already* been patches accepted to the new ARes!
