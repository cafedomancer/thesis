{"body": "Thanks, @senny and @pixeltrix. Actually I always found it dumb to have to specify both \"format: true\" and \"format: /json/\" in the constraints to force the format. First I did try to do something like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nget '/products.json' => 'products#index'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that didn't work if I remembered correctly. When I asked in the rails-core list a while ago I was pointed that I should be doing as in the route I pointed out when I reported the issue.\r\n\r\nBut I certainly prefer your suggested approach, thanks.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14248269", "created_at": "2013-02-28T18:21:21Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9469#issuecomment-14248269", "updated_at": "2013-02-28T18:21:21Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9469, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/rosenfeld", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2abdb50caf0dc5b510330f68b02db8e4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c3aa93f86af77d8b1071d5fd2b4c91a.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2abdb50caf0dc5b510330f68b02db8e4", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "rosenfeld", "type": "User", "id": 32246, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e8fdbd3543c1510097ba"}, "id": 14248269, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9469"}
