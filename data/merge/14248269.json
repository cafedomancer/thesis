Actually I always found it dumb to have to specify both \"format: true\" and \"format: /json/\" in the constraints to force the format. First I did try to do something like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nget '/products.json' => 'products#index'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that didn't work if I remembered correctly. When I asked in the rails-core list a while ago I was pointed that I should be doing as in the route I pointed out when I reported the issue.\r\n\r\nBut I certainly prefer your suggested approach, thanks.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e8fdbd3543c1510097ba"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9469#issuecomment-14248269"}
