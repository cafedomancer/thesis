(tongue firmly in cheek). regardless, why is something fielding says in a blog post or mailing list more authoritative than a rfc? \r\n\r\nshould a spec need interpretation? i don't think so. a specification is by definition a precise description of requirements.\r\n\r\nand can someone actually show a concrete example of a problem this solves?
