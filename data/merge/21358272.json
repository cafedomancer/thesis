For example, assets are not precompiled by default on production and production environment use eager loading of constants.\r\n\r\nI don't see any problem to have these differences, and the index page returning 404 is fine to me too.\r\n\r\nCan not these tutorials being updated to actually tell the people what is going on with the information page?
