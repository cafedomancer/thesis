Adding a method won't cause any existing apps to break, and therefore acceptable in any release. I think we're on the same page, just want you to know where I'm coming from :)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ff5fbd3543c15100be05"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7159#issuecomment-7268043"}
