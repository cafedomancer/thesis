Adding a method won't cause any existing apps to break, and therefore acceptable in any release. I think we're on the same page, just want you to know where I'm coming from :)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ff5fbd3543c15100be05"}, "issue_id": 7159, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7268043", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7159#issuecomment-7268043", "updated_at": "2012-07-26T02:49:00Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee", "login": "GeekOnCoffee", "gravatar_id": "0bc875c603399dbfb1f166548c64dd76", "html_url": "https://github.com/GeekOnCoffee", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/0bc875c603399dbfb1f166548c64dd76?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0836cd30df8e8f76a7dd3124c0ee4550.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 240650, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-26T02:49:00Z", "id": 7268043, "owner": "rails"}
