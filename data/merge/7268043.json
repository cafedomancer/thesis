{"body": "Thanks to all who contribute to rails, especially @rafaelfranca and @tenderlove and all who are active in commenting on and pulling issues... \n\n@rafaelfranca my argument that it's not a change is that removing or changing methods breaks people apps... this is a bad thing, and should be avoided in minor releases. Adding a method won't cause any existing apps to break, and therefore acceptable in any release. I think we're on the same page, just want you to know where I'm coming from :)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7268043", "created_at": "2012-07-26T02:49:00Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7159#issuecomment-7268043", "updated_at": "2012-07-26T02:49:00Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7159, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/GeekOnCoffee", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/0bc875c603399dbfb1f166548c64dd76?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0836cd30df8e8f76a7dd3124c0ee4550.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/received_events", "gravatar_id": "0bc875c603399dbfb1f166548c64dd76", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "GeekOnCoffee", "type": "User", "id": 240650, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GeekOnCoffee/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ff5fbd3543c15100be05"}, "id": 7268043, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7159"}
