I have a feeling if anyone else saw this pull request, it would be rejected.\r\n\r\n**You** were _trying_ to make a point, by creating a pull-request for something that you happen to find incorrect, but of which @fxn has been **consistently** saying the same thing, namely that that\u2019s how it\u2019s done in Rails. And what did he do? He merged it, because he was being consistent, again.\r\n\r\nDo you really think other core members don\u2019t know of this patch? Face it, it hasn\u2019t been rejected because nobody else saw it. Everybody in the Rails community has seen this shitstorm.\r\n\r\n> Nobody likes an API that doesn't do things that people expect.\r\n\r\nRead all posts from @fxn from the very beginning. What people _should_ expect with Ruby is to **not** expect the `true` and `false` singletons from predicate methods. It really is that simple.\r\n\r\n> Just because the documentation says so doesn't mean it's law and must be correct. Think of this as the pro-gay marriage protests.\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely **nothing** like pro-gay marriage protests. Your opinion != the same as basic human rights, please don\u2019t compare such an important topic with a \u2018minor\u2019 issue like this.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing this all because you care, but there is no point in arguing over it anymore. It is **not** going to change. The only thing that all this does is take away more time that @fxn and other core members (and you) could have spent on stuff that _is_ actually open for discussion.\r\n\r\nJust remember, this is **not** a democracy.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238159dbd3543c15100dd27"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5582#issuecomment-5236195"}
