I've created a new branch with the suggestions and squashed into a single commit.\r\n\r\nSHA1: 77a075b05a0993b994f0caf1a0b6b8bb1ae63f18\r\n\r\n1. Use `supports_explain?` to detect connection adapter capabilities\r\n2. Warning if `auto_explain_threshold_in_seconds` is set in the config, but the adapter does not support it\r\n3. Updated to use `ActiveRecord::Base` instead of `ActiveRecord::Model`\r\n4. Removed the `all` finder call and replaced it with `to_a` in the test\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380cb5bd3543c15100d1d1"}, "issue_id": 6197, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10608144", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6197#issuecomment-10608144", "updated_at": "2012-11-21T18:13:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blakesmith/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blakesmith/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blakesmith/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blakesmith/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/blakesmith", "login": "blakesmith", "gravatar_id": "072d6a69039ba4ca7e4d9c8118225cf0", "html_url": "https://github.com/blakesmith", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blakesmith/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blakesmith/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blakesmith/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/072d6a69039ba4ca7e4d9c8118225cf0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3316d81092ede6ad999c632bc1b57e4b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blakesmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 44368, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blakesmith/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-21T18:13:51Z", "id": 10608144, "owner": "rails"}
