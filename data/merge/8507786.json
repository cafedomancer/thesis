I'll have to ask you one more thing though, to review your commit message and improve the changelog a bit with an example of how to use this new feature. This will help others to understand the reasoning and how to use the feature at the same time when reading the commits or the changelog.\n\nHere's an explanation [about how to go with the commit message](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#commit-your-changes), and [here's another about changelogs](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#updating-the-changelog).\n\nI'll merge it afterwards.
