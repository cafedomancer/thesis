When I run \"rake,\" I get errors about duplicate constraints and tables. Rails.env within the tasks is set to \"development\", so it's trying to pipe structure.sql into my development database for tests, which is wrong, since we're running tests. We can't just hardcode the task to use abcs['test']['database'] though, because then we lose the ability to manually run \"rake db:structure:load\" and have the structure sucked into the development DB.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383d4bbd3543c15101046c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2948#issuecomment-2351321"}
