{"body": "@jeremy, I can't reproduce that failure. I've fiddled around with a few scenarios and I can't get it to fail. (The easy way to get a schema.rb with the old version option in the define method is to copy the bottommost version from the migrations block and add it as a param: `ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 12345) do`. That should save some mucking about with git, and doesn't seem to change anything for me.) Anyway, I can't repro the failure. The missing metadata from the schema_migrations table is expected when loading using :versions, but the tests should pass, and that's what I see.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11173487", "created_at": "2012-12-09T17:56:06Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8399#issuecomment-11173487", "updated_at": "2012-12-09T17:56:06Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8399, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshsusser", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/9f0f89bbd9e1ecfbaab6584e429b7a2f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F1c9ac0159c94d8d0cbedc973445af2da.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9f0f89bbd9e1ecfbaab6584e429b7a2f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "joshsusser", "type": "User", "id": 156, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshsusser/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f39cbd3543c15100a883"}, "id": 11173487, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8399"}
