I've fiddled around with a few scenarios and I can't get it to fail. (The easy way to get a schema.rb with the old version option in the define method is to copy the bottommost version from the migrations block and add it as a param: `ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 12345) do`. That should save some mucking about with git, and doesn't seem to change anything for me.) Anyway, I can't repro the failure. The missing metadata from the schema_migrations table is expected when loading using :versions, but the tests should pass, and that's what I see.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f39cbd3543c15100a883"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8399#issuecomment-11173487"}
