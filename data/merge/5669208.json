It does, by the way, already - config.active_support.bare  = false will raise an error since ActiveSupport::JSON::Encoding.bare doesn;t exist. We will need to blacklist those options that should not be assigned - much worse than current 3 hardcoded options(whitelisted). \n* really, config.active_support is not supposed to be only about JSON encoding. it's just options related to AS.
