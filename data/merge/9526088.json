This would include railtie gems. So if you do app/assets in your gem, those are auto included. lib/assets and vendor/assets are by hand. I think that this models Rails' default autoloading strategy of app/ is autoloaded and autorequired, while lib/ and vendor/ have to be explicit.\r\n> \r\n> Depends on #7964 being merged first.\r\n> \r\n> /cc @dhh\r\n> \r\n> You can merge this Pull Request by running:\r\n> \r\n>   git pull https://github.com/josh/rails only-precompile-app-assets-by-default\r\n> Or view, comment on, or merge it at:\r\n> \r\n>   https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7968\r\n> \r\n> Commit Summary\r\n> \r\n> \t\u2022 Only compile non-js/css under app/assets by default\r\n> File Changes\r\n> \r\n> \t\u2022 M railties/lib/rails/application/configuration.rb (2)\r\n> Patch Links\r\n> \r\n> \t\u2022 https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7968.patch\r\n> \t\u2022 https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7968.diff\r\n> \u2014\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\r\n> \r\n> ", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f73dbd3543c15100afe6"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7968#issuecomment-9526088"}
