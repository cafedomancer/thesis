{"body": "Thanks for your reply @sorentwo \r\n\r\nHow can I exactly restart the build? The corresponding button in Travis CI seems to be disabled.\r\n\r\nI understand (and agree with) your concerns about mixing adapters. The rationale behind it is because of our CI environment: we have two applications sharing the database (which is in my opinion, also a bad idea) and the only way to make it possible to run parallel builds is to be able to isolate databases. It is certainly possible to do with Postgresql as well, but I guess sqlite was just easier.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/21251506", "created_at": "2013-07-19T14:09:14Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11455#issuecomment-21251506", "updated_at": "2013-07-19T14:09:14Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 11455, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antonio/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antonio/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antonio/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/antonio", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antonio/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/antonio", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antonio/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/d069e59fd24494550627bdadbfaa18ed?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc97fc9737012376eee6fe4e2c9191c4d.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antonio/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antonio/received_events", "gravatar_id": "d069e59fd24494550627bdadbfaa18ed", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antonio/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "antonio", "type": "User", "id": 17516, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/antonio/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d41bbd3543c151008044"}, "id": 21251506, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11455"}
