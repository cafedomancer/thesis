After following backtraces I have tracked down the issue to this (executed under _activesupport_):\r\n\r\n    $ ruby -W -Ilib -ractive_support -ractive_support/deprecation -e1\r\n\r\nand seem to be related to the fact that _active_support.rb_ sets an `autoload` for `:Deprecation`. I bet something funky is going on related to `autoload`. I'll leave it for tonight, will keep you guys posted interesting puzzle :).", "_id": {"$oid": "523dd81abd354364b900a93d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7650#issuecomment-9158920"}
