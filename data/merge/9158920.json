{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7650", "repo": "rails", "body": "The interesting thing is that the warning is raised after the Deprecation class is defined. After following backtraces I have tracked down the issue to this (executed under _activesupport_):\r\n\r\n    $ ruby -W -Ilib -ractive_support -ractive_support/deprecation -e1\r\n\r\nand seem to be related to the fact that _active_support.rb_ sets an `autoload` for `:Deprecation`. I bet something funky is going on related to `autoload`. I'll leave it for tonight, will keep you guys posted interesting puzzle :).", "_id": {"$oid": "523dd81abd354364b900a93d"}, "issue_id": 7650, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9158920", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7650#issuecomment-9158920", "updated_at": "2012-10-04T22:02:41Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-04T22:01:22Z", "id": 9158920, "owner": "rails"}
