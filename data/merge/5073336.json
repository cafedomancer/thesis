{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3408", "repo": "rails", "body": "Out of curiosity, why was this decision made? It looks like Rails still tries to load turn if it's there (see [test_help.rb](https://gist.github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/test_help.rb)). If it is a matter of disliking its presentation, I think it would be trivial to customize its output however we like. We could modify one of its existing presenters or create a new one.\r\n\r\nI'd be willing to work on this if I knew what people wanted. As a Rails/MiniTest user, I like the different formats/options that turn supports. I would be sad to see it go for correctable reasons.", "_id": {"$oid": "523836bcbd3543c15100fd94"}, "issue_id": 3408, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5073336", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3408#issuecomment-5073336", "updated_at": "2012-04-11T16:51:26Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dontangg/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dontangg/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dontangg/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dontangg/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dontangg", "login": "dontangg", "gravatar_id": "2a0884a4b78879d0cc48b72808ea0cdd", "html_url": "https://github.com/dontangg", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dontangg/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dontangg/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dontangg/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2a0884a4b78879d0cc48b72808ea0cdd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F31f04666bb2a79566cc0e7a5df3c1371.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dontangg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 319091, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dontangg/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-11T16:51:26Z", "id": 5073336, "owner": "rails"}
