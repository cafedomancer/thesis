It looks like Rails still tries to load turn if it's there (see [test_help.rb](https://gist.github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/test_help.rb)). If it is a matter of disliking its presentation, I think it would be trivial to customize its output however we like. We could modify one of its existing presenters or create a new one.\r\n\r\nI'd be willing to work on this if I knew what people wanted. As a Rails/MiniTest user, I like the different formats/options that turn supports. I would be sad to see it go for correctable reasons.", "_id": {"$oid": "523836bcbd3543c15100fd94"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3408#issuecomment-5073336"}
