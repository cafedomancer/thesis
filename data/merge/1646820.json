{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2034", "repo": "rails", "body": "@spastorino We purposefully avoided using `#partial_path`, and deprecated it in this patch.  That's what the above discussion is about.  With this change, ActiveModel classes are not guaranteed to have a meaningful partial path which applies to all instances.  For instance, `FormHelper::FormBuilder.model_name.partial_path` is gone in this patch, replaced with an implementation of `#to_path`, because different FormBuilder instances should render different partials.\r\n\r\nDeprecating `#partial_path` discourages authors from depending on an interface which might be nonexistent or meaningless.", "_id": {"$oid": "523fe3a5bd354364b901bfb0"}, "issue_id": 2034, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1646820", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2034#issuecomment-1646820", "updated_at": "2011-07-25T16:01:09Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Peeja/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Peeja/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Peeja/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Peeja/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Peeja", "login": "Peeja", "gravatar_id": "d069ac0170dc6c93bad77734258fadae", "html_url": "https://github.com/Peeja", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Peeja/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Peeja/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Peeja/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d069ac0170dc6c93bad77734258fadae?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F97416ac0f58056947e2eb5d5d253d4f2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Peeja/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2407, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Peeja/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-07-25T16:01:09Z", "id": 1646820, "owner": "rails"}
