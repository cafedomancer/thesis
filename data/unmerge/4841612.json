However, if you generate an app without using a --skip flag, it will generate a development.rb that calls active_record configs that do not exist. That's another bug.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to remove ActionMailer, but there's no support for it in --skip flags that I could see and it suffers from the same development.rb problem as ActiveRecord.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Rails really can be stripped to the gills is a really compelling and little-known capability. It should be a first-class feature and promoted more heavily, imho, especially given how many apps use alternative data stores, etc.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238149fbd3543c15100dbf3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5652#issuecomment-4841612"}
