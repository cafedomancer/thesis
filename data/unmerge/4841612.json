{"body": "It is indeed possible to run an app without ActiveRecord, and the configurations support it. However, if you generate an app without using a --skip flag, it will generate a development.rb that calls active_record configs that do not exist. That's another bug.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to remove ActionMailer, but there's no support for it in --skip flags that I could see and it suffers from the same development.rb problem as ActiveRecord.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Rails really can be stripped to the gills is a really compelling and little-known capability. It should be a first-class feature and promoted more heavily, imho, especially given how many apps use alternative data stores, etc.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4841612", "created_at": "2012-03-30T12:39:39Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5652#issuecomment-4841612", "updated_at": "2012-03-30T12:39:39Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5652, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/headius", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f1d37642fdaa1662ff46e4c65731e9ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F36bedb6eb7152f39b16328448942822b.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f1d37642fdaa1662ff46e4c65731e9ab", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "headius", "type": "User", "id": 10135, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238149fbd3543c15100dbf3"}, "id": 4841612, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5652"}
