{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7879", "repo": "rails", "body": "@NZKoz Thank you for your feedback. I'm open to changing the cookie store itself instead. I agree it is cleaner to do it in the cookie store than in a template. However, I think that doing it in a template allows for some situations that are hard to do when the logic is coded in the cookie store. For example, you might run an billing application and a webstore application on the same domain that share the same cookie so employees only have to login once. In this case you want to force_ssl for the admin application but the cookie should not be ssl only since the webstore also uses regular http. Does this seem a valid reason to do it in the template or should I modify this PR to put the logic in the cookie store?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7fbbd3543c15100b17b"}, "issue_id": 7879, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9294751", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7879#issuecomment-9294751", "updated_at": "2012-10-10T09:11:16Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dosire/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dosire/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dosire/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dosire/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dosire", "login": "dosire", "gravatar_id": "64fa0c156c8c444cbbe09593baea6e3e", "html_url": "https://github.com/dosire", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dosire/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dosire/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dosire/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/64fa0c156c8c444cbbe09593baea6e3e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F946d0a5d15b2453834ed5400b57c89c9.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dosire/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 22061, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dosire/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-10T09:10:58Z", "id": 9294751, "owner": "rails"}
