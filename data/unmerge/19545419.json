{"body": "@egilburg, thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\n1. `.unscoped` still exists. It removes the default scope.\r\n2. I don't expect a method called `.except` to ignore the default scope. I think acting on the default scope should be `.except`'s default behavior. If people want to override that behavior, perhaps an option should be passed, e.g. `User.except(:where, with_default_scope: false)`\r\n3. `.unscope` already works like I think you suggested, e.g.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.where(awesome: true).order('age DESC').unscope(:where, :order).order('age ASC').to_sql\r\n# => \"SELECT \\\"users\\\".* FROM \\\"users\\\"   ORDER BY age ASC\"\r\n```", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/19545419", "created_at": "2013-06-17T13:42:08Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10966#issuecomment-19545419", "updated_at": "2013-06-17T13:42:08Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 10966, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davejachimiak/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davejachimiak/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davejachimiak/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davejachimiak", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davejachimiak/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/davejachimiak", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davejachimiak/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ec70e3175c0450768e5f920192a83dcb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F1cae3acf66eb38e52c8364700f227044.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davejachimiak/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davejachimiak/received_events", "gravatar_id": "ec70e3175c0450768e5f920192a83dcb", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davejachimiak/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "davejachimiak", "type": "User", "id": 1289249, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davejachimiak/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237da2ebd3543c1510086b5"}, "id": 19545419, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10966"}
