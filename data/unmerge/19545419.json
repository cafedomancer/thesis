It removes the default scope.\r\n2. I don't expect a method called `.except` to ignore the default scope. I think acting on the default scope should be `.except`'s default behavior. If people want to override that behavior, perhaps an option should be passed, e.g. `User.except(:where, with_default_scope: false)`\r\n3. `.unscope` already works like I think you suggested, e.g.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.where(awesome: true).order('age DESC').unscope(:where, :order).order('age ASC').to_sql\r\n# => \"SELECT \\\"users\\\".* FROM \\\"users\\\"   ORDER BY age ASC\"\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "5237da2ebd3543c1510086b5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10966#issuecomment-19545419"}
