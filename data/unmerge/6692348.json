A few questions:\n\n1) Do we really need to make the LookupContext change? The lookup context exists just in the request life-cycle, it is not shared in between requests.\n\n2) I don't like the Resolver change. Instead of having 4 nested hashes each with its lock, maybe we should simply have one hash/cache and use an array with 4 elements as key. Can we have some benchmarks in that code to show which one is faster?\n\n3) Many of the changes done here are simply a cache. Using a structure with a mutex for such cases in MRI is an unnecessary overhead, since a simple Hash would be fine because we don't care if two different threads eventually execute the same piece of code. What do you think? Can we have a structure that complies with this?", "_id": {"$oid": "523801f5bd3543c15100c22a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6917#issuecomment-6692348"}
