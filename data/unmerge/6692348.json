{"body": "This looks great overall, thanks! A few questions:\n\n1) Do we really need to make the LookupContext change? The lookup context exists just in the request life-cycle, it is not shared in between requests.\n\n2) I don't like the Resolver change. Instead of having 4 nested hashes each with its lock, maybe we should simply have one hash/cache and use an array with 4 elements as key. Can we have some benchmarks in that code to show which one is faster?\n\n3) Many of the changes done here are simply a cache. Using a structure with a mutex for such cases in MRI is an unnecessary overhead, since a simple Hash would be fine because we don't care if two different threads eventually execute the same piece of code. What do you think? Can we have a structure that complies with this?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6692348", "created_at": "2012-07-01T09:53:30Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6917#issuecomment-6692348", "updated_at": "2012-07-01T09:53:30Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6917, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523801f5bd3543c15100c22a"}, "id": 6692348, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6917"}
