{"body": "@radar But, I mean, have you looked at where they're implemented? The module is 80 lines of code and it's well-tested: asking the Rails core to continue maintenance of it isn't exactly like asking them upkeep and maintain a new Hoover Dam.

It's for people who are new to Rails to provide them an easy method to build queries. As I said, I approve of the new syntax, but I think deprecating the old syntax just because it's ugly in some cases isn't worth breaking compatibility and removing some neat-looking syntactical sugar.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4773986", "created_at": "2012-03-28T17:35:17Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5639#issuecomment-4773986", "updated_at": "2012-03-28T17:35:17Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5639, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/Veraticus", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7668fdefde74e42b48fe657d71cdcc4c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ffaa26d60bb56a66a97ad9ae9849656d5.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7668fdefde74e42b48fe657d71cdcc4c", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "Veraticus", "type": "User", "id": 67038, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523814d7bd3543c15100dc48"}, "id": 4773986, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5639"}
