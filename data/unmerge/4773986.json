The module is 80 lines of code and it's well-tested: asking the Rails core to continue maintenance of it isn't exactly like asking them upkeep and maintain a new Hoover Dam. It's already done pretty much.\r\n\r\nIt's true it employs method_missing (which is slow), but I think we can all agree that most power users of Rails won't use the syntax anyway (precisely because of its slowness). It's for people who are new to Rails to provide them an easy method to build queries. As I said, I approve of the new syntax, but I think deprecating the old syntax just because it's ugly in some cases isn't worth breaking compatibility and removing some neat-looking syntactical sugar.", "_id": {"$oid": "523814d7bd3543c15100dc48"}, "issue_id": 5639, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4773986", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5639#issuecomment-4773986", "updated_at": "2012-03-28T17:35:17Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus", "login": "Veraticus", "gravatar_id": "7668fdefde74e42b48fe657d71cdcc4c", "html_url": "https://github.com/Veraticus", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7668fdefde74e42b48fe657d71cdcc4c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ffaa26d60bb56a66a97ad9ae9849656d5.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 67038, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-28T17:35:17Z", "id": 4773986, "owner": "rails"}
