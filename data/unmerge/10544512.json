The native\r\nRuby implementations all return an instance of Time in the local time\r\nzone so this commit changes the various implementations to match that.\r\n\r\nThe one possible source of breakages is the changing of String#to_time\r\nto return a local time rather than a UTC time by default. Research seems\r\nto show that use of this method is low so any likely impact is minimal.\r\n\r\nCloses #2453\r\n```\r\n\r\nso leave it open for now, thanks.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238435ebd3543c151010c23"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2453#issuecomment-10544512"}
