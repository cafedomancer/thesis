{"body": "I know this issue is closed, but I ran across another issue along the same vein, although it is a little more involved than changing the default inflections. When you generate a scaffold with a name that ends in \"ve\", in a few cases the controller will have the instance variables pluralized than singularized again, without regard to the original singular scaffold name. So for example, if I generate a scaffold named Agave the controller will generate this:\r\n\r\n    class AgavesController < ApplicationController\r\n      # GET /agaves\r\n      # GET /agaves.json\r\n      def index\r\n        @agaves = Agave.all\r\n\r\n        respond_to do |format|\r\n          format.html # index.html.erb\r\n          format.json { render json: @agaves }\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n\r\n      # GET /agaves/1\r\n      # GET /agaves/1.json\r\n      def show\r\n        @agafe = Agave.find(params[:id])\r\n\r\n        respond_to do |format|\r\n          format.html # show.html.erb\r\n          format.json { render json: @agafe }\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n\r\nSo even though I gave the name Agave to the generator, the given name was ignored while creating the instance variables for agaves#show (and update, destroy, etc.), resulting in \"agafe\" instead of \"agave\". \r\n\r\nI can just go ahead and change the inflections file (inflect.irregular 'agave', 'agaves') and then generate the scaffold, but I think this is in general probably not the desired behavior for the scaffold. Changing the default behavior of \"ve\"-> \"f\" would fix this particular issue, but there are probably other cases where pluralizing for the controller than singularizing for the instance variables could also be a gotcha.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12379348", "created_at": "2013-01-17T17:39:23Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6820#issuecomment-12379348", "updated_at": "2013-01-17T17:41:32Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6820, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hahahana/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hahahana/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hahahana/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hahahana", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hahahana/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/hahahana", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hahahana/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9f45b377729db1230c3e09ed3bd1c906?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Febbade605eca6ed17eca8619cbe3836e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hahahana/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hahahana/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9f45b377729db1230c3e09ed3bd1c906", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hahahana/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "hahahana", "type": "User", "id": 2406167, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hahahana/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523803dbbd3543c15100c4e3"}, "id": 12379348, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6820"}
