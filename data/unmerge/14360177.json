{"body": "@MarcoPeraza is absolutely right.  Whatever happened to \"convention over configuration\"?!  The cleanest solution I can find out there is the [`quiet_assets` gem](https://github.com/evrone/quiet_assets) which monkey-patches `Rails::Rack::Logger`.  If so, that's a sad state of affairs indeed, considering the *large* number of developers who have fallen foul of this.\r\n\r\n@josevalim, [your comment above](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3795#issuecomment-3549669) has been linked to at least twice, by @guilleiguaran [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2639#issuecomment-3635046) and [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/4569#issuecomment-3594500) as \"details about why we won't silent the request logs\", but that's very misleading, because your comment doesn't cover *why* this functionality won't be implemented at all; it simply says that it won't be.\r\n\r\nBy \"you can inherit from the Rails::Rack::Logger in your app and special case it\", you seem to be suggesting that every single Rails developer who doesn't want spam in their development log should become a Rack specialist and reinvent the same wheel?!  Maybe that wasn't the message you intended, but that's how it comes across.\r\n\r\nI see that [sprockets will log more silently in Rails 4.0](http://yetimedia.tumblr.com/post/33320732456/moving-forward-with-the-rails-asset-pipeline).  That's great, but what about ActionPack?\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I am not *necessarily* disagreeing with your decision not to make Rails special-case middleware.  But given the number of developers who have been bitten by this, I **am** strongly disagreeing with how this is being handled in terms of (a) finding an alternative user-friendly solution, and (b) communication and documentation of that solution.
