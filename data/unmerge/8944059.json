If that is your main concern we can fall back on a static 500 using the previous code https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/public_exceptions.rb. It may interest you to know that the current \"static\" error pages are currently rendered by ruby code. \n\nThese dynamic error pages covered in the Railties test suite can be ensured to be error free by default, any errors introduced would be via a programmer. Developers can still do what I did by themselves, this just makes it much much easier. We shouldn't kill something because developers might introduce bugs to their site with it...
