The only part of it that would really need to be synced with Rails would be 1) [the default directories](https://github.com/bf4/code_metrics/blob/master/lib/code_metrics/stats_directories.rb#L38) and 2) [the Railtie](https://github.com/bf4/code_metrics/blob/master/lib/code_metrics/railtie.rb#L7).  And the stats task is only run by devs from the commandline (i.e. won't break Rails)\r\n\r\nNote: The code that determines which directories to run on, what to name the stats, and if they are tests is much more flexible now.  It does include the Rails defaults, but otherwise is independent of Rails and has a backwards compatible API.\r\n\r\nThe code_metrics gem itself has no dependencies and never will.", "_id": {"$oid": "523c9922bd354364b90018ae"}, "issue_id": 11148, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/24196324", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11148#issuecomment-24196324", "updated_at": "2013-09-10T23:13:22Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4", "login": "bf4", "gravatar_id": "a4e890117ae8877a5c86d5710bfcd594", "html_url": "https://github.com/bf4", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/a4e890117ae8877a5c86d5710bfcd594?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc14ca2c02996c1f0dcd65fbbf0142c02.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 142914, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-09-10T21:31:04Z", "id": 24196324, "owner": "rails"}
