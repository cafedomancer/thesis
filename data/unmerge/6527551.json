Worse, if you try to dump the schema it will now show **t.datetime :bonus_time** effectively doing something you didn't do yourself.\n\nSo, now, there are two options I can think of, undoing the pull request above and letting the migration and the generated schema.rb be the same or raising an exception if people try to use **t.time** on SQLite, since the pull request above says it doesn't work.", "_id": {"$oid": "523803a7bd3543c15100c475"}, "issue_id": 6835, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6527551", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6835#issuecomment-6527551", "updated_at": "2012-06-23T19:35:25Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio", "login": "mauricio", "gravatar_id": "a91bd6cef23eb3516245a092e196c4da", "html_url": "https://github.com/mauricio", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/a91bd6cef23eb3516245a092e196c4da?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc7be03f5d811ed29c328526ca8ab0d61.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5742, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-23T19:35:13Z", "id": 6527551, "owner": "rails"}
