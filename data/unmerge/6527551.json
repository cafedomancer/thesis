Worse, if you try to dump the schema it will now show **t.datetime :bonus_time** effectively doing something you didn't do yourself.\n\nSo, now, there are two options I can think of, undoing the pull request above and letting the migration and the generated schema.rb be the same or raising an exception if people try to use **t.time** on SQLite, since the pull request above says it doesn't work.", "_id": {"$oid": "523803a7bd3543c15100c475"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6835#issuecomment-6527551"}
