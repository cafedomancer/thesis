Note that:\n\n    some_relation = unscoped.red.published.where(...)\n    some_relation.__id__ == some_relation.without_default.__id__\n\nThe separate whithout_default \"branch\" is maintained only when necessary.\n\nI'm not sure whether it should be user facing. It's definitely a hack. I think building a relation from unscoped is preferred, but given current API we sometimes need to \"add\" it to relations we receive as arguments retroactively. It's not there to be a feature on it's own. We might find a better way to implement default and named scopes in the future and I wouldn't weep telling this method bye bye.", "_id": {"$oid": "523866a7bd3543c15101281d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/169#issuecomment-726804"}
