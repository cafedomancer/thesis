But I don't see any way or trick, metaprogramming not works here :(\n\nPS not sure about backport.. people always get mad when something gets broken. I only want make rails *4* super secure, 3 is pretty old :)", "_id": {"$oid": "5238067dbd3543c15100c91d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6569#issuecomment-6075567"}
