{"body": "oh, Hi, you could call me :)\n\n@mrbrdo thank you for awesome efforts, idea of checking formats on bootstrap is nice.\n\nI'm not sure but this is how I have been writing code a few years ago:\n```\nunless url =~ /^http/\n  url = \"http://#{utl}\"\nend\n```\nbecause validator cannot add 'http' if user forgot it and the code is explicit thus patch will not check it. that's how I exploited 'javascript:' urls. \n\nI would be just happy if there were an option Regexp.multiline which we could set to +false+ built in ruby. But I don't see any way or trick, metaprogramming not works here :(\n\nPS not sure about backport.. people always get mad when something gets broken.
