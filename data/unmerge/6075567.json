But I don't see any way or trick, metaprogramming not works here :(\n\nPS not sure about backport.. people always get mad when something gets broken. I only want make rails *4* super secure, 3 is pretty old :)", "_id": {"$oid": "5238067dbd3543c15100c91d"}, "issue_id": 6569, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6075567", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6569#issuecomment-6075567", "updated_at": "2012-06-02T07:34:10Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov", "login": "homakov", "gravatar_id": "d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d", "html_url": "https://github.com/homakov", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc1464ded796adc7ac65355e3cc0df165.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 174693, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-02T07:32:40Z", "id": 6075567, "owner": "rails"}
