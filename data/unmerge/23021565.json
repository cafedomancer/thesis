We should be very cautious when adding something to the core extensions and we prefer to not add if it will not give a really good improvement in the way you write your code.\r\n\r\n`true`/`false` is a common idiom in the Ruby community and I don't think we need to change it.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend to you suggest this change to Ruby core instead. I don't think it belongs to Rails.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cfbdbd3543c151007ba7"}, "issue_id": 11962, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/23021565", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11962#issuecomment-23021565", "updated_at": "2013-08-21T14:36:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca", "login": "rafaelfranca", "gravatar_id": "0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03", "html_url": "https://github.com/rafaelfranca", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2c7b84fa30f0cea96a90729afe2970a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 47848, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-08-21T14:36:37Z", "id": 23021565, "owner": "rails"}
