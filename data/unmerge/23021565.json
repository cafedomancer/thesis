We should be very cautious when adding something to the core extensions and we prefer to not add if it will not give a really good improvement in the way you write your code.\r\n\r\n`true`/`false` is a common idiom in the Ruby community and I don't think we need to change it.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend to you suggest this change to Ruby core instead. I don't think it belongs to Rails.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cfbdbd3543c151007ba7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11962#issuecomment-23021565"}
