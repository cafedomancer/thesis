{"body": "I have seen that you committed your stuff to the master branch. Don't do this in your next pull requests, it makes rebasing harder. :) Anyway, maybe you can fix it by doing this:\r\n\r\n    git fetch origin # Get latest origin\r\n    git checkout -b origin/master # Create a new branch based on origin/master\r\n    git cherry-pick SHA_OF_YOUR_ORIGINAL_COMMIT # Pick your changes in the new branch\r\n    git checkout -b checkbox_patch # Give a name to this new branch\r\n    git push -u origin checkbox_patch # Push the branch\r\n\r\nAnd you just need to resend your pull request. you can close this one and create a new one!
