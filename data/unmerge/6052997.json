I'm looking at all of the date & time code as there's a lot of stuff that's based on 1.8's limitations - for example our `DateTime#to_time` can be removed and we don't need to convert to UTC to compare times as they work fine with `<=>` and different offsets.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238435ebd3543c151010c20"}, "issue_id": 2453, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6052997", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2453#issuecomment-6052997", "updated_at": "2012-06-01T03:47:58Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-01T03:47:58Z", "id": 6052997, "owner": "rails"}
