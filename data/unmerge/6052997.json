I'm looking at all of the date & time code as there's a lot of stuff that's based on 1.8's limitations - for example our `DateTime#to_time` can be removed and we don't need to convert to UTC to compare times as they work fine with `<=>` and different offsets.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238435ebd3543c151010c20"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2453#issuecomment-6052997"}
