It's basically doing the same thing already. Of course, that increases dependence on ARel being coupled to the DB connection, which is something we've talked about trying to reduce.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I've been busy lately with work and prepping for talks, and unable to spend time on AR/ARel work. Based on the regression needing a fix, and lack of time to work something cleaner out, I'm not really opposed to merging this -- just think we need to keep in mind it's a band-aid.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ebb4bd3543c151009b93"}, "issue_id": 9265, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14041589", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9265#issuecomment-14041589", "updated_at": "2013-02-25T13:44:24Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie", "login": "ernie", "gravatar_id": "2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542", "html_url": "https://github.com/ernie", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6a600c968f4e6a843dcaf600c1694e42.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 14947, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-25T13:44:24Z", "id": 14041589, "owner": "rails"}
