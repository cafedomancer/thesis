I'm not sure how many people want to make that environment configurable. So I'm closing this as 'not really a bug.'\n\nIf you'd like to add this as a new feature, please do and submit a pull request, but I think this would add complexity for very little gain. You can always ask rails-core for feedback too, before working on it.
