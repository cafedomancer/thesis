{"body": "@masterkain predicates in Ruby are not required, nor expected, to return any particular value. Client code cannot depend on the value either, unless documented (like `Integer#nonzero?`). The code in that application was subtly using the returned value. That's broken, nobody is telling anything about the return value.\r\n\r\nThe singletons `true` and `false` are there so that you *can* use them in predicates if nothing else makes sense.\r\n\r\nFor example, you'd write\r\n\r\n    def has_name?\r\n      first_name && last_name\r\n    end\r\n\r\nyou could also wirte\r\n\r\n\r\n    def has_name?\r\n      first_name && last_name ? true : false\r\n    end\r\n\r\nbut that's redundant and nobody requires/expects the predicate to be written that way.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4668207", "created_at": "2012-03-23T21:21:21Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4668207", "updated_at": "2012-03-23T21:21:21Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5329, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "fxn", "type": "User", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e1ff"}, "id": 4668207, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5329"}
