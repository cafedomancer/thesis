So in any case Gem will come into picture. What do you think?\r\n\r\n@tenderlove: I believe, a problem is a problem and it must be addressed. With the string checking approach, Ruby major version 9 is not less than 10. Yeah, major version will not be there in very near future, but this is a failure. For minor version numbers also, is there a policy that prevents them rise past 9?\r\n\r\nAdditionally this is not only about Ruby versioning. Any gem/lib version can be checked/compared smartly with these methods.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384966bd3543c151011221"}, "issue_id": 2024, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1540823", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2024#issuecomment-1540823", "updated_at": "2011-07-10T05:15:52Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bratish/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bratish/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bratish/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bratish/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bratish", "login": "bratish", "gravatar_id": "2e9fedaf01e874c630ae7f635ae584ca", "html_url": "https://github.com/bratish", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bratish/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bratish/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bratish/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2e9fedaf01e874c630ae7f635ae584ca?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb1944a6e7766517587d764a3c519017c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bratish/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 336893, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bratish/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-07-10T05:15:52Z", "id": 1540823, "owner": "rails"}
