{"body": "Ok... there are several issues here...\r\n\r\n1. I am persuaded that this ought to work with serialization. However I am not keen on the proposed code for doing this. I have spent quite a bit of time trying to unify the AR attributes code recently and this feels like it's taking a step backwards. I have a half-written patch to make pluck work with serialization using existing code paths, which I'll aim to finish over the next few days. I think this aspect is uncontroversial so we can put it in 3.2.\r\n2. I am not any more keen on `select_value` as a name than `value_of` - both of them sound like they return a single value when in fact they do not. `pluck` is by far the most natural name that has been considered IMO.\r\n3. There's a question of whether we should support multiple values. This seems ok to me though I don't think the feature is 'broken' without it, so it doesn't seem crucial to solve for 3.2. The main difficulty is naming/API. Supposing we stuck with `pluck` for the singular, I potentially think `pluck_attributes` could work, as 'attributes' is synonymous with 'hash of attribute/value pairs' in AR.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to get serialization working, leave the name as `pluck`, and come back to the question of multiple attributes after 3.2 unless a consensus emerges about how the API should be.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3223963", "created_at": "2011-12-20T19:35:26Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3223963", "updated_at": "2011-12-20T19:35:26Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3871, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jonleighton", "type": "User", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f64d"}, "id": 3223963, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3871"}
