It is thus not obvious that base is needed.\r\n\r\nThe RDoc of initialize could have internal documentation for base, as it has internal documentation for the existing parameter. It could say, \"base is blah, needed to grab the appropriate connection\"... something like that.\r\n\r\nIf we do not do that, one can certainly scan the file for usages of @base and reverse engineer why is there, but it is much more efficient for the next guy that wants to understand the code to explain it upfront. In addition, the next guys \"knows\", rather than guesses the motivation.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238390ebd3543c15101006a"}, "issue_id": 3240, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2321956", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3240#issuecomment-2321956", "updated_at": "2011-10-07T14:25:14Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-10-07T14:25:14Z", "id": 2321956, "owner": "rails"}
