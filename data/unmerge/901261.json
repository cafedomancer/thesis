Currently, the scaffold generator hasn't changed much at all since 2.3 and still contains the ugly `respond_to` blocks.\r\n\r\nThis pull request first removes the comments from the scaffold controller (people should know this already, and if not they can learn from the Routing and Getting Started guides). That's the simple part.\r\n\r\nThe second commit here removes the ugly `respond_to` blocks, replacing it with a controller-level `respond_to` call, which is exactly how the `respond_to` blocks act. Well, at least as far as our testing goes.\r\n\r\nTwo more things for further concern.\r\n\r\nFirst is that the scaffold generator generates functional tests for the HTML component that's generated, but doesn't generate XML tests. Is there any particular reason for this?\r\n\r\nSecond: Is there any particular reason why these controllers respond to XML rather than JSON these days? I would think that JSON is the preferred API respond format. This could just be a case of extreme bikeshedding though.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238651abd3543c1510126a7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/233#issuecomment-901261"}
