I came across this patch as part of my work, and don't have a single mysql (or oracle or whatever) instance. So the setup time alone is something I already don't have :( Investigation is worthwhile, but there is at least a workaround for now...\r\n\r\n    e.message =~ /#{Regexp.escape(\"Resque::TermException\")}/\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever some helpful advice:\r\n\r\nI recommend removing our dependency on the whim of `translate_exception`. Instead every adapter needs to implement `can_handle_exception?` which would allow the adapter to claim or not that exception. This code can then known to re-raise the exception or proceed with translate.\r\n\r\nIt's a tad bit of complexity but ensures every adapter now or in the future will not have such an issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeally, however, the exception thrown should be a SqlException type, and only catch that, everything else should be ignored in this catch block.
