Indeed, referencing an asset without digest by accident is unfortunate, but removing the non digest version is the wrong answer to this problem.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't feel strong about this feature but I am fine with an ENV variable since it feels less intrusive than adding a new option to `config.assets`.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238191abd3543c15100e12e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5379#issuecomment-4442543"}
