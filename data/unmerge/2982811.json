Also, see my comment above about log:clear... same arg could be made for it being an alias.\r\n\r\net al. -> before you mention this should be an alias, please provide the source for how you would make it dynamic no matter what machine or rails env (machine can have multiple env too) && how you would deploy it that's clean and simple && can be typed the same way every single time like rake tail.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52383163bd3543c15100f74e"}, "issue_id": 3802, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2982811", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3802#issuecomment-2982811", "updated_at": "2011-12-01T22:04:25Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal", "login": "scottvrosenthal", "gravatar_id": "6a54102d3af783bab96b14b59f25f8b0", "html_url": "https://github.com/scottvrosenthal", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/6a54102d3af783bab96b14b59f25f8b0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc02a484869d06f0d258fa58ce110ac8a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 507446, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-01T22:04:25Z", "id": 2982811, "owner": "rails"}
