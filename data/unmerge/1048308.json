{"body": "I've written some simple tests to support the PostgreSQL tsvector data type patch for #6073.\n\nWriting these tests has raised some questions. Whilst we can now schema dump without fear, is the data type useful on it's own? I can't think of a case where I would use the tsvector type without a trigger and of course that is not something that is presently supported in the schema DSL (or perhaps I've missed something?).\n\nTests are here, on the tsvector_tests_6073 branch:\nhttps://github.com/scottlowe/rails/commits/tsvector_tests_6073\n\n_EDIT:_\n\nI have read the Rails submission guidelines and have now created a patch and attached it to Lighthouse ticket #6073:\n\nhttps://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/6073\n\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1048308", "created_at": "2011-04-23T20:19:04Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/197#issuecomment-1048308", "updated_at": "2011-04-25T20:46:32Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 197, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottlowe/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottlowe/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottlowe/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottlowe", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottlowe/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/scottlowe", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottlowe/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/293c15263e19c837818f0d75a17fc98d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb510cb4921d9b6551f5b001a0f142638.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottlowe/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottlowe/received_events", "gravatar_id": "293c15263e19c837818f0d75a17fc98d", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottlowe/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "scottlowe", "type": "User", "id": 241747, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottlowe/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523865eebd3543c151012769"}, "id": 1048308, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/197"}
