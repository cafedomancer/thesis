Whilst we can now schema dump without fear, is the data type useful on it's own? I can't think of a case where I would use the tsvector type without a trigger and of course that is not something that is presently supported in the schema DSL (or perhaps I've missed something?).\n\nTests are here, on the tsvector_tests_6073 branch:\nhttps://github.com/scottlowe/rails/commits/tsvector_tests_6073\n\n_EDIT:_\n\nI have read the Rails submission guidelines and have now created a patch and attached it to Lighthouse ticket #6073:\n\nhttps://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/6073\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523865eebd3543c151012769"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/197#issuecomment-1048308"}
