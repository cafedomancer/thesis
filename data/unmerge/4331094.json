So of the three issues you mentioned, none of them apply here as far as I can tell.  I'm loathe to introduce another configuration option 'just because maybe there are issues with other crypto systems'.\r\n\r\n@igrigorik could you get some word from your friends on the google security team who suggested the feature, see if we can get a final answer on it?\r\n\r\n@hmcfletch: don't make those changes until we get final word on whether they're necessary.  If they *are* truly necessary then the fallback behaviour you're describing shouldn't be implemented as we'd be allowing users to run less-secure systems.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381d9dbd3543c15100e5de"}, "issue_id": 5034, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4331094", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5034#issuecomment-4331094", "updated_at": "2012-03-05T20:32:14Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-05T20:32:14Z", "id": 4331094, "owner": "rails"}
