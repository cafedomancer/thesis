{"body": "@mhutchin Interesting. I looked back at the link I posted at the top of the discussion and the RFC @dlee cited, which contains PATCH, appears to be obsoleted by one that I cited, which only has a reference to PATCH at the end. Here are the two documents:\r\n\r\n* [RFC 2068: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2068/rfc2068) - Contains PATCH in the main body. January 1997.\r\n* [RFC 2616: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) - Has a reference patch at the end (only Ctrl-F result for PATCH in the text version). June 1999. Says *Obsoletes: 2068* at the top.\r\n\r\nThe reference to PATCH at the end says:\r\n\r\n> The PATCH, LINK, UNLINK methods were defined but not commonly implemented in previous versions of this specification.
