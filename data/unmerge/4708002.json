{"body": "@fxn that's just the problem though, it's not YOUR code base. If anyone, it belongs to DHH. For the rest, anyone that has contributed, or even attempted to contribute holds a certain amount of ownership. Indeed, anyone that uses an application is a stakeholder, and entitled to respect. \r\n\r\nI'm comfortable with everything but nil being true, that doesn't mean it's wrong to be more explicit/strict. Indeed, it helps with issues like the conventions being different between languages -- the perfect example being javascript, which is a part of every rails app.\r\n\r\nSo why then do you have a problem with a more explicit rendering of truth? What benefit do you gain in *this* instance to having the method return 0? The removal of !! is fine (I can get behind that), however === is a very fitting replacement, it is not only clear, but it also helps someone out who has a 75k line codebase.\r\n\r\n@fxn for the record, I am calm. I'm frustrated at your attitude, and the lack of control that the community has over the rails code base.
