For the rest, anyone that has contributed, or even attempted to contribute holds a certain amount of ownership. Indeed, anyone that uses an application is a stakeholder, and entitled to respect. \r\n\r\nI'm comfortable with everything but nil being true, that doesn't mean it's wrong to be more explicit/strict. Indeed, it helps with issues like the conventions being different between languages -- the perfect example being javascript, which is a part of every rails app.\r\n\r\nSo why then do you have a problem with a more explicit rendering of truth? What benefit do you gain in *this* instance to having the method return 0? The removal of !! is fine (I can get behind that), however === is a very fitting replacement, it is not only clear, but it also helps someone out who has a 75k line codebase.\r\n\r\n@fxn for the record, I am calm. I'm frustrated at your attitude, and the lack of control that the community has over the rails code base. But I'm hardly frothing at the mouth.", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd41"}, "issue_id": 5580, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4708002", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4708002", "updated_at": "2012-03-27T01:20:49Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis", "login": "vertis", "gravatar_id": "b2a9e57c2a8ed757833b4c787b6c51d5", "html_url": "https://github.com/vertis", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b2a9e57c2a8ed757833b4c787b6c51d5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84e17d99a1e885b374d0cb2e25d7aa4b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 19705, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-27T01:20:49Z", "id": 4708002, "owner": "rails"}
