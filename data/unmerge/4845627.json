{"body": "I'm using this pattern in about 4 places in my company's app personally and I found another 6 places where another developer used it.\r\n\r\nHere's the most basic example I can think of:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nprofile = @user.profile || @user.profile.build\r\nprofile.update_attributes(...)\r\n\r\n# or\r\n@user.profile.update_or_create(attributes)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther real world examples include setting up a row in a payment processing information table, looping through financial transactions to create or update approved amounts, syncing up a cached feed item with the parent content item, updating membership log entries, etc.\r\n\r\nThe proposed version also supports blocks for protected attributes. I think it does deserve some more discussion on how it operates a `has_many` vs `has_one` -- but `#update_attributes` only works on a single record so I designed the API for the method with that in mind [1].\r\n\r\nI do understand your concern about method bloat (and I *hate* bloat), but I did see this as a common pattern in our application.\r\n\r\nSo given we have the following in the API:\r\n\r\n- first_or_create[!]\r\n- first_or_initialize\r\n- update_or_create\r\n\r\nCan we think of any other similar methods that would want to be added that could cause bloat? I think these cover all common patterns.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to look at this pull.\r\n\r\n[1] Off topic, but would you consider accepting a pull for `#update_attributes` allowing a block for protected attributes? via `record.tap(&block)`?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4845627", "created_at": "2012-03-30T16:11:09Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5648#issuecomment-4845627", "updated_at": "2012-03-30T16:14:10Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5648, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/clifton", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/4cede21ea96795d2de831e9981cc81cd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc27181a18d3b30d14d66a1a56c068548.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/received_events", "gravatar_id": "4cede21ea96795d2de831e9981cc81cd", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "clifton", "type": "User", "id": 14217, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523814b1bd3543c15100dc08"}, "id": 4845627, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5648"}
