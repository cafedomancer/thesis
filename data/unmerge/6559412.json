That's why it's \"a uniform\", but \"an hour\", since uniform is pronounced  /\u02c8jun\u0259f\u0254rm/ and hour /\u02c8a\u028a\u025a/. English pronunciation rules are very complex compared with other languages like German or Korean (I usually compare it to Chinese, since you basically have to learn how to pronounce each word). So it looks like an endless task to make it perfect and there isn't much gain for usual Rails apps.\n\nMake a gem if you like (plugins are dead), but this shouldn't be merged into Rails.", "_id": {"$oid": "523803e6bd3543c15100c4fe"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6813#issuecomment-6559412"}
