I see the problem.  I'm not sure what to do though.  You would have the database creation problem essentially just once, right?  I'm not sure this is a large enough use case to warrant adding support to rails itself.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be better to hook in to the `db:create` rake task?  For example, add a rake task to your rails application that changes the rails environment, but only on database create:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ntask 'muck_with_env' do\r\n  Rails.env = 'create_database'\r\nend\r\n\r\ntask 'db:create' => 'muck_with_env'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen adjust your yaml file accordingly:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nproduction:\r\n  adapter: mysql\r\n  database: omg_development\r\n  user: aaron\r\n  password: omg\r\n\r\ncreate_database:\r\n  adapter: mysql\r\n  database: omg_development\r\n  user: root\r\n  password: zomg\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "52384e30bd3543c151011564"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1802#issuecomment-1460122"}
