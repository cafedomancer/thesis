You would have the database creation problem essentially just once, right?  I'm not sure this is a large enough use case to warrant adding support to rails itself.\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be better to hook in to the `db:create` rake task?  For example, add a rake task to your rails application that changes the rails environment, but only on database create:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ntask 'muck_with_env' do\r\n  Rails.env = 'create_database'\r\nend\r\n\r\ntask 'db:create' => 'muck_with_env'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen adjust your yaml file accordingly:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nproduction:\r\n  adapter: mysql\r\n  database: omg_development\r\n  user: aaron\r\n  password: omg\r\n\r\ncreate_database:\r\n  adapter: mysql\r\n  database: omg_development\r\n  user: root\r\n  password: zomg\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "52384e30bd3543c151011564"}, "issue_id": 1802, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1460122", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1802#issuecomment-1460122", "updated_at": "2011-06-29T00:20:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "login": "tenderlove", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-29T00:20:23Z", "id": 1460122, "owner": "rails"}
