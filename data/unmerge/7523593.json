{"body": "Ok thx @avit, now I understand better. @fxn I think it's not a good idea, to try to guess the 'same character' as the literal uses, especially since the gsub in the original heredoc replaces spaces as wel as tabs. which is in itself interesting.\n_ = space - = tab:\n```\n_-LINE1\n_--_LINE2\n_-__LINE3\n__LINE4\n```\nstrip_heredoc will produce:\n```\nLINE1\n-_LINE2\n__LINE3\nLINE4\n```\nWhich is interesting at the least.\n\nSo, I think guessing what the original literal used for indentation is not very reliable. Adding an extra option as to what character to use when indenting, it's easy to do, and then strip_heredoc can be used to indent with stars, stripes,  BELL characters etc etc... not sure if we need that.
