Adding an extra option as to what character to use when indenting, it's easy to do, and then strip_heredoc can be used to indent with stars, stripes,  BELL characters etc etc... not sure if we need that. Please advice.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fdc7bd3543c15100bba8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7263#issuecomment-7523593"}
