Adding an extra option as to what character to use when indenting, it's easy to do, and then strip_heredoc can be used to indent with stars, stripes,  BELL characters etc etc... not sure if we need that. Please advice.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fdc7bd3543c15100bba8"}, "issue_id": 7263, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7523593", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7263#issuecomment-7523593", "updated_at": "2012-08-06T13:19:57Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares", "login": "acesuares", "gravatar_id": "3dfc4136712f120023f092004f062cc4", "html_url": "https://github.com/acesuares", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dfc4136712f120023f092004f062cc4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Faeefb050911334869a7a5d9e4d0e1689.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2784, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-06T13:19:57Z", "id": 7523593, "owner": "rails"}
