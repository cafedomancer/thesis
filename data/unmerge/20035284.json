One of your migrations, even if it's not the last one is not up. Therefore you need to execute it.\r\nMigrations aren't always run in their order. That's why you shouldn't version them manually with a number, but use the automatic timestamp.\r\n\r\nImagine the following:\r\nIn the master branch of your repository, you create migration A.\r\nThen you start working in a branch and create migration B. You don't merge your work yet.\r\nYou fix a bug in master and create migration C. You deploy with this new migration.\r\n\r\nWhen you're going to merge your second branch and your migration B will end up in master, it needs to be applied in production as it hasn't been yet. Your proposal breaks this, which is the common usage of migrations.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237db20bd3543c1510087e5"}, "issue_id": 10856, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20035284", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10856#issuecomment-20035284", "updated_at": "2013-06-26T09:17:33Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu", "login": "dmathieu", "gravatar_id": "6fa1cdda524d49996a8bc6917328de3d", "html_url": "https://github.com/dmathieu", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6fa1cdda524d49996a8bc6917328de3d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F71ee911dd06428a96c143a0b135041a4.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9347, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-06-26T09:17:33Z", "id": 20035284, "owner": "rails"}
