We should also consider this for the existing --skip-active-record and --skip-sprockets we have today as well (to be clear, those commands should stop touching rails/all and instead simplifying the Gemfile).", "_id": {"$oid": "5238149fbd3543c15100dbec"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5652#issuecomment-4810795"}
