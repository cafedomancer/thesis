{"body": "I would like to suggest a different approach. `require \"rails/all\"` actually catches load errors, this means we can remove a framework, like ActiveRecord completely and it would work fine.\r\n\r\nSo if you are doing the effort of removing parts of Rails, we should do it at the Gemfile level, so we wouldn't even bother with downloading such dependencies. We should also consider this for the existing --skip-active-record and --skip-sprockets we have today as well (to be clear, those commands should stop touching rails/all and instead simplifying the Gemfile).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4810795", "created_at": "2012-03-29T11:48:51Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5652#issuecomment-4810795", "updated_at": "2012-03-29T11:48:51Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5652, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238149fbd3543c15100dbec"}, "id": 4810795, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5652"}
