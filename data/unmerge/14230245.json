{"body": "Changes were necessary to make Rails master work with Rack ~> 1.5.0, as you can see in 7d624e0e8cfa3adffd8f475e3588d83f3b367c24. I don't think those changes are going to be backported, so I guess 3-2-stable will have to stick with 1.4.x for now. Also, as a side note, we'd have to use `~> 1.4` instead of `>= 1.4.5`, otherwise we'd be freeing too much (for instance, rack 2.0 could be used and would be a breakage).
