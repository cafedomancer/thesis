While this may not be general practice right now, there exist some natural client-side counterparts for these actions, such as Collections in Backbone and bulk updates in Ember. I am seeing quite a number of requests for bulk updates in my projects and right now these result in a custom action or a nested JSON update on the parent object.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238043cbd3543c15100c583"}, "issue_id": 6780, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6424476", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6780#issuecomment-6424476", "updated_at": "2012-06-19T13:24:02Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stiller/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stiller/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stiller/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stiller/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stiller", "login": "stiller", "gravatar_id": "150b7dfb3c10c343999c41183f3253cd", "html_url": "https://github.com/stiller", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stiller/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stiller/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stiller/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/150b7dfb3c10c343999c41183f3253cd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8a5512b423c7f0d2c8543d145073903f.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stiller/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 548535, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stiller/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-19T13:24:02Z", "id": 6424476, "owner": "rails"}
