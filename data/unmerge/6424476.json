While this may not be general practice right now, there exist some natural client-side counterparts for these actions, such as Collections in Backbone and bulk updates in Ember. I am seeing quite a number of requests for bulk updates in my projects and right now these result in a custom action or a nested JSON update on the parent object.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238043cbd3543c15100c583"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6780#issuecomment-6424476"}
