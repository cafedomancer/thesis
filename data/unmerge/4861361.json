One thing is that additions to active support should be mainly things that are needed for rails development. The other is that for me it's much less readable then just creating a range. If I see `a.to_range` I don't immediately see what's that and need to check documentation. When I see `0..a` I know what's going on.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238143ebd3543c15100db76"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5687#issuecomment-4861361"}
