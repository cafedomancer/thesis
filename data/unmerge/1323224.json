It works regardless of whether `XX:Location` is defined in `app/models/xx/location.rb` or `app/models/xx/location/location.rb` as we would prefer, but only if `require_dependency 'xx/location/geoip_geocoder'` is present. Without the `require_dependency` it does not work even if `Location` is defined in `app/models/xx/location.rb` rather than `xx/location/location.rb`.  Also note there is no `app/models/xx.rb` as the top-level module is merely an empty namespace. \r\n\r\nI'll extract a bare example this eve.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523857a2bd3543c151011b90"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1422#issuecomment-1323224"}
