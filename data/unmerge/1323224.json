{"body": "@pixeltrix Thanks, but nope that's not the problem.  It works regardless of whether `XX:Location` is defined in `app/models/xx/location.rb` or `app/models/xx/location/location.rb` as we would prefer, but only if `require_dependency 'xx/location/geoip_geocoder'` is present. Without the `require_dependency` it does not work even if `Location` is defined in `app/models/xx/location.rb` rather than `xx/location/location.rb`.  Also note there is no `app/models/xx.rb` as the top-level module is merely an empty namespace. \r\n\r\nI'll extract a bare example this eve.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1323224", "created_at": "2011-06-07T22:49:06Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1422#issuecomment-1323224", "updated_at": "2011-06-07T22:49:06Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 1422, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tribalvibes/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tribalvibes/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tribalvibes/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tribalvibes", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tribalvibes/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tribalvibes", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tribalvibes/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/251e5499b8ad4f6518e29a6a6f2b2c82?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F38c0bb6153a37c4f42fbe27a45e3b51f.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tribalvibes/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tribalvibes/received_events", "gravatar_id": "251e5499b8ad4f6518e29a6a6f2b2c82", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tribalvibes/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tribalvibes", "type": "User", "id": 167275, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tribalvibes/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523857a2bd3543c151011b90"}, "id": 1323224, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1422"}
