Especially if you take deeply nested examples.\r\n\r\nBecause of this rails raises only once it encounters loaded models where a desired association is missing. These loaded models (which in itself could already come from a nested association) could either come from a normal association or from a polymorphic one.\r\n\r\nIf you want I can extend the tests to show a case where nested eager loading through an polymorphic association can both hit an existing and non existing association in the same query.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237daa9bd3543c151008730"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10912#issuecomment-20067435"}
