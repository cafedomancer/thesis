They could cause the application to generate an expired cookie that expired at a known time in cases where you currently generate non-expiring cookies?  They couldn't force your application to generate *unsigned* cookie or force your app to generate cookies which expire later than you wanted them to?\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d81cbd3543c151008451"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11168#issuecomment-20719431"}
