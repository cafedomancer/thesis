They could cause the application to generate an expired cookie that expired at a known time in cases where you currently generate non-expiring cookies?  They couldn't force your application to generate *unsigned* cookie or force your app to generate cookies which expire later than you wanted them to?\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d81cbd3543c151008451"}, "issue_id": 11168, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20719431", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11168#issuecomment-20719431", "updated_at": "2013-07-10T03:18:01Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-10T03:18:01Z", "id": 20719431, "owner": "rails"}
