{"body": "@drogus My intention is following:\r\n\r\n* If we pass the params without a `:password` key, validation SHOULD be passed.\r\n* If we pass the params with a blank password, validation should not be passed (as the current implementation).\r\n\r\nSometimes, I want to have a user who has nil password and can not be authenticated as a  kind of place holder.\r\n\r\nThink of the case that the user registration process goes like this:\r\n\r\n* A user without password is saved and a confirmation mail is sent to his/her email address.\r\n* He/she clicks the confirmation URL.\r\n* Then, he/she enters the password to complete the user registration process.\r\n\r\n`has_secure_password` might has been implemented for simpler cases, but I think we could utilize it in a broader context with some modifications.\r\n\r\nThat said, I admit my commit can introduce unintentional changes of behavior into existing Rails applications.\r\n\r\nI will think more deeply on this theme.
