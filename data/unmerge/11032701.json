Since there's a workaround to get it to work as well then it's better to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nThis caution is due to personal experience - once I broke someone's app in production when I backported a fix in how nested resource route names were generated. The name generated was so wrong I thought it was impossible that anyone could be using it but that assumption turned out to be wrong so I never assume anything now.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f5efbd3543c15100ad3c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8109#issuecomment-11032701"}
