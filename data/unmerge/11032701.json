Since there's a workaround to get it to work as well then it's better to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nThis caution is due to personal experience - once I broke someone's app in production when I backported a fix in how nested resource route names were generated. The name generated was so wrong I thought it was impossible that anyone could be using it but that assumption turned out to be wrong so I never assume anything now.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f5efbd3543c15100ad3c"}, "issue_id": 8109, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11032701", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8109#issuecomment-11032701", "updated_at": "2012-12-05T08:04:09Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-05T08:04:09Z", "id": 11032701, "owner": "rails"}
