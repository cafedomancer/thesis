{"body": "You shouldn't call allocate without calling initialize.  Calling allocate without calling initialize leaves the object's internal state in an unknown state.

If this warning is produced via *normal* object allocation (allocate, then initialize, or possibly via some sort of marshalling) then we should find the source.\r\n\r\nIn other words, please don't call methods against an object that hasn't had a chance to initialize it's own internal state.
