{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9575", "repo": "rails", "body": "I'm :-1: on this change for this purpose. For your CMS to now work with a Rails app the developer must add this line of code to their app, and they also lose some non trivial pages such as `/rails/info/routes` which is unexpected. Instead it would be the same amount of work to add a route helper method for users of your CMS to the config/routes.rb file. Something like:\r\n\r\n`mount_cms`\r\n\r\nThat would only over-write that one route for the root.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1bd9bd354364b9004bb2"}, "issue_id": 9575, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14474718", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9575#issuecomment-14474718", "updated_at": "2013-03-06T00:22:11Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems", "login": "schneems", "gravatar_id": "db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e", "html_url": "https://github.com/schneems", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ef42a6eab211ddd71ac423a80b42d15.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 59744, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-06T00:22:11Z", "id": 14474718, "owner": "rails"}
