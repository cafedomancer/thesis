For your CMS to now work with a Rails app the developer must add this line of code to their app, and they also lose some non trivial pages such as `/rails/info/routes` which is unexpected. Instead it would be the same amount of work to add a route helper method for users of your CMS to the config/routes.rb file. Something like:\r\n\r\n`mount_cms`\r\n\r\nThat would only over-write that one route for the root.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1bd9bd354364b9004bb2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9575#issuecomment-14474718"}
