I think it's possible to address that problem; I'll pursue it with @sferik in a plugin, and perhaps come back around if we think we cracked the nut.\r\n\r\nAre there any other concerns you have about the approach that you haven't outlined? I want our plugin to be as robust as possible in the face of real-world controllers, and any additional issues you forsee would help us.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f1c8bd3543c15100a4da"}, "issue_id": 8597, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11656272", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8597#issuecomment-11656272", "updated_at": "2012-12-24T08:43:02Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats", "login": "wycats", "gravatar_id": "428167a3ec72235ba971162924492609", "html_url": "https://github.com/wycats", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/428167a3ec72235ba971162924492609?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa87ff679a2f3e71d9181a67b7542122c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-24T08:43:02Z", "id": 11656272, "owner": "rails"}
