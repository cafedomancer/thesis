I hadn't heard the preloading argument before and I find it compelling. I think it's possible to address that problem; I'll pursue it with @sferik in a plugin, and perhaps come back around if we think we cracked the nut.\r\n\r\nAre there any other concerns you have about the approach that you haven't outlined? I want our plugin to be as robust as possible in the face of real-world controllers, and any additional issues you forsee would help us.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f1c8bd3543c15100a4da"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8597#issuecomment-11656272"}
