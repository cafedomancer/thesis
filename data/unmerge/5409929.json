Check it out:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef new_method; target_object.original_method; end\r\n```\r\n\r\nJoking aside, I am +0 on this feature.  I'll never use it, but I'm not against it.  As long as we don't have a wave of pull requests changing every `def` style delegate to some \"fun\" metaprogramming, I am happy. :-)", "_id": {"$oid": "52383b01bd3543c15101024d"}, "issue_id": 3069, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5409929", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3069#issuecomment-5409929", "updated_at": "2012-04-29T23:46:10Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "login": "tenderlove", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-29T23:46:10Z", "id": 5409929, "owner": "rails"}
