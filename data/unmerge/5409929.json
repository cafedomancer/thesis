{"body": "Check out my sweet DSL for adding delegate methods, it's called `def`, and it lets you delegate to any object using any name you could ever want!  Check it out:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef new_method; target_object.original_method; end\r\n```\r\n\r\nJoking aside, I am +0 on this feature.  I'll never use it, but I'm not against it.  As long as we don't have a wave of pull requests changing every `def` style delegate to some \"fun\" metaprogramming, I am happy. :-)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5409929", "created_at": "2012-04-29T23:46:10Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3069#issuecomment-5409929", "updated_at": "2012-04-29T23:46:10Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3069, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tenderlove", "type": "User", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383b01bd3543c15101024d"}, "id": 5409929, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3069"}
