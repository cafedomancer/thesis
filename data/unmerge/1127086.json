{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/433", "repo": "rails", "body": "Hi, clemens. I am sorry, but I don't get what you are trying to say or why  are you talking about PostgreSQL. This patch is about getting useful values from `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` or other MySQL functions, which rely on the setting of  time zone of the MySQL RDBMS (`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`, `CURRENT_TIME()`, `CURRENT_DATE()`, and `FROM_UNIXTIME()`). \n\nAs I wrote in the first post, the setting of the time zone of the MySQL RDBMS is usually `SYSTEM`, which means, that the time zone is set to whatever the system administrator decided, which will usually be the local time zone  of the place, where the system physically resides.\n\nYou have correctly pointed out, that the values stored by Rails in `datetime` columns are usually in `UTC`.  What you get if you query (from Rails app.) the `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` of any such value?  (Sidenote: `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` function returns an integer value, so no time-related conversion in Rails takes place.) Now is the answer \"that depens, probably something incorrect, because the `UTC` value was interpreted (in MySQL) as a value in `SYSTEM` time zone, which is ... (_something nobody cares, because you are using some hosting abroad_)\".  My intend is to use this patch to set the time zone of my sessions to `UTC` to always get proper values from functions like `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` applied to `datetime` type of values.  If someone is using `config.active_record.default_timezone = :local`, then he'll probably not set his sessions time zone to `UTC`.", "_id": {"$oid": "52386039bd3543c151012231"}, "issue_id": 433, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1127086", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/433#issuecomment-1127086", "updated_at": "2011-05-09T23:46:31Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r-stu31/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r-stu31/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r-stu31/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r-stu31/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/r-stu31", "login": "r-stu31", "gravatar_id": "acb03e5fa57c2956511155344d14afaf", "html_url": "https://github.com/r-stu31", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r-stu31/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r-stu31/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r-stu31/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/acb03e5fa57c2956511155344d14afaf?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f7a867c879df6fd7d841570a89a80d4.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r-stu31/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 325471, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/r-stu31/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-09T23:44:15Z", "id": 1127086, "owner": "rails"}
