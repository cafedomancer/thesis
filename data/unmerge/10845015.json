It's the same reason a complete modification of the hash styles throughout the code is not done at once: it can break pull requests, and it's considered a cosmetic change. So we're doing that step by step, as we touch the code, and I believe we should do the same here. I did that specifically to remove that FIXME comment. Thanks anyway :)", "_id": {"$oid": "523d94ccbd354364b90080c6"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8367#issuecomment-10845015"}
