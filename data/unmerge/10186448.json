So `deep_diff` will be more useful when you need descriptive messages. So I'm wondering are there any such cases when `diff` is a better choice than `deep_diff`?\r\n\r\nAlso here is a couple of strings from Rails using `diff`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# FIXME: minitest does object diffs, do we need to have our own?\r\nmessage ||= sprintf(\"The recognized options <%s> did not match <%s>, difference: <%s>\",\r\n  request.path_parameters, expected_options, expected_options.diff(request.path_parameters))\r\nassert_equal(expected_options, request.path_parameters, message)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`FIXME` says that there is a `MiniTest` alternative which is way less descriptive:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n[15] pry(main)> diff({a: 1, b: 2}, {b: 2})\r\n=> \"Expected: {:a=>1, :b=>2}\\n  Actual: {:b=>2}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo WDYT is the best way we should act here?", "_id": {"$oid": "523da671bd354364b9008bca"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8142#issuecomment-10186448"}
