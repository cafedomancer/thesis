{"body": "Looking around a bit, it seems this has been reported a few times previously, and is causing problems for people who expect the nested syntax to work: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6718 as an example. The popular library CanCan generates nested conditions, so I imagine there are quite a few apps out there that would rely on this being supported, especially considering it used to work. Although I've been able to find a few mentions of this issue, I haven't found an explanation as to why the behavior was changed.
