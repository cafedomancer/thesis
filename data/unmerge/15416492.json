{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9906", "repo": "rails", "body": "Looking around a bit, it seems this has been reported a few times previously, and is causing problems for people who expect the nested syntax to work: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6718 as an example. The popular library CanCan generates nested conditions, so I imagine there are quite a few apps out there that would rely on this being supported, especially considering it used to work. Although I've been able to find a few mentions of this issue, I haven't found an explanation as to why the behavior was changed. Is there a reason not to support both authors: {organizations: {name: 'Acme'}} AND organizations: {name: 'Acme'}?\r\n\r\nOther issues I've found relating to this:\r\nhttps://github.com/ryanb/cancan/issues/646\r\nhttps://github.com/ryanb/cancan/issues/830\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9511\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6718 (mentioned above)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e5a9bd3543c1510093b6"}, "issue_id": 9906, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/15416492", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9906#issuecomment-15416492", "updated_at": "2013-03-25T19:18:34Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanOlson/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanOlson/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanOlson/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanOlson/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanOlson", "login": "DanOlson", "gravatar_id": "60ceb22fcf6ffa23d72ed1fc08609a22", "html_url": "https://github.com/DanOlson", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanOlson/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanOlson/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanOlson/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/60ceb22fcf6ffa23d72ed1fc08609a22?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa849be4ba51cba266f2580f38c172765.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanOlson/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 815279, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/DanOlson/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-25T19:18:34Z", "id": 15416492, "owner": "rails"}
