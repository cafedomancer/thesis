The popular library CanCan generates nested conditions, so I imagine there are quite a few apps out there that would rely on this being supported, especially considering it used to work. Although I've been able to find a few mentions of this issue, I haven't found an explanation as to why the behavior was changed. Is there a reason not to support both authors: {organizations: {name: 'Acme'}} AND organizations: {name: 'Acme'}?\r\n\r\nOther issues I've found relating to this:\r\nhttps://github.com/ryanb/cancan/issues/646\r\nhttps://github.com/ryanb/cancan/issues/830\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/issues/9511\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6718 (mentioned above)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e5a9bd3543c1510093b6"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9906#issuecomment-15416492"}
