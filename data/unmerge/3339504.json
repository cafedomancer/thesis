There are several cases:\r\n\r\n\\1. Manipulate string in model/controller/helper. That's unavoidable.\r\n\\2. Controller method for view display, ex :\r\n\r\ndrop_breadcrumb \"Home\"\r\ndrop_breadcrumb \"Post List\"\r\ndrop_breadcrumb \"Post Title\"\r\n\r\nwill render Home >> Post List >> Post Title\r\n\r\nIf we use breadcrumb in View, it will be massy and ULTRA slow. ( write Ruby LOGIC in View is ULTRA slow )\r\n\r\n\\ 3. Single language application. Rails's I18n is not that perfect. Usually we don't use I18n in only one-language application. Because if we do, the application will suddenly be massy and unmaintainable. Nobody would want to use I18n since day-one when specs says that is NOT an international application.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238291dbd3543c15100efe8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4271#issuecomment-3339504"}
