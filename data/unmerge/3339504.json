{"body": "That's not that simple. There are several cases:\r\n\r\n\\1. Manipulate string in model/controller/helper. That's unavoidable.\r\n\\2. Controller method for view display, ex :\r\n\r\ndrop_breadcrumb \"Home\"\r\ndrop_breadcrumb \"Post List\"\r\ndrop_breadcrumb \"Post Title\"\r\n\r\nwill render Home >> Post List >> Post Title\r\n\r\nIf we use breadcrumb in View, it will be massy and ULTRA slow. ( write Ruby LOGIC in View is ULTRA slow )\r\n\r\n\\ 3. Single language application. Rails's I18n is not that perfect. Usually we don't use I18n in only one-language application. Because if we do, the application will suddenly be massy and unmaintainable. Nobody would want to use I18n since day-one when specs says that is NOT an international application.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3339504", "created_at": "2012-01-03T13:01:51Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4271#issuecomment-3339504", "updated_at": "2012-01-03T13:02:14Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 4271, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xdite/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xdite/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xdite/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xdite", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xdite/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/xdite", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xdite/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/19e786a2a74377ff6e052d87fd8d1fa8?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3799b2e805a7fa8b076fc020574a73b2.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xdite/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xdite/received_events", "gravatar_id": "19e786a2a74377ff6e052d87fd8d1fa8", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xdite/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "xdite", "type": "User", "id": 9004, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xdite/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238291dbd3543c15100efe8"}, "id": 3339504, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/4271"}
