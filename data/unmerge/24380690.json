{"body": ":-1: for me. It's quite difficult to comment on a contrived example, but generally you can just override `serializable_hash` and add whatever you need then merge it with `super(...)`. If you need anything more complicated than that, you should probably look into `jbuilder` / `ActiveModel::Serializer`, etc.\r\n\r\nBy the way, methods like `as_json` and `serializable_hash` are intended to be consumed by encoders/serializes. If you are consuming them in your code for purposes other than encoding/serializing the object, you are probably doing it wrong, see my comment [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12183#issuecomment-24209662).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/24380690", "created_at": "2013-09-13T08:39:04Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12212#issuecomment-24380690", "updated_at": "2013-09-13T08:39:12Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 12212, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/chancancode", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b407b57d02a2e41c7ba54441391d9ce.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/received_events", "gravatar_id": "22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "chancancode", "type": "User", "id": 55829, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cdeabd3543c1510079e0"}, "id": 24380690, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/12212"}
