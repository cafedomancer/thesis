It's quite difficult to comment on a contrived example, but generally you can just override `serializable_hash` and add whatever you need then merge it with `super(...)`. If you need anything more complicated than that, you should probably look into `jbuilder` / `ActiveModel::Serializer`, etc.\r\n\r\nBy the way, methods like `as_json` and `serializable_hash` are intended to be consumed by encoders/serializes. If you are consuming them in your code for purposes other than encoding/serializing the object, you are probably doing it wrong, see my comment [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12183#issuecomment-24209662).", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cdeabd3543c1510079e0"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12212#issuecomment-24380690"}
