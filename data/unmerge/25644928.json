Prohibit is about being (not) allowed to do something; prevent is about being stopped from doing something.  You would say neither \"camping is prevented\" nor \"the policeman prohibited me from...\".\r\n\r\nIn this context, we are not talking about rules preventing you from doing something, but rather about there being some \"physical\" limitation on your ability to accomplish the task.\r\n\r\nProbably not well stated, and maybe it's less grammar than word meaning, but \"prohibit\" is the wrong word for this context.
