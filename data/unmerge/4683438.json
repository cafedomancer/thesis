I cannot see a use case where the user of `xhr?` can find the offset value helpful. So we can afford not committing to an implementation. The predicate has a standard predicate contract, it is enough.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523815d4bd3543c15100dd9c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5572#issuecomment-4683438"}
