{"body": "@yfeldblum : as the article describes (in the very first paragraph) binary is the name for any prefix/notation using 1024 as exponent base, so IEC is also a binary prefix/notation. So binary is too generic to use in this case as it covers two out of three cases, that is why I choose customary, since both JEDEC mentions the use of KB in their publication, and the whole wiki article uses the word \"customary\" all places where it is necessary to differentiate between IEC and \"customary\" prefix/notation (when speaking of binary prefix).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9123592", "created_at": "2012-10-03T21:48:04Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7835#issuecomment-9123592", "updated_at": "2012-10-03T21:48:04Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7835, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jarl-dk", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/968fba3ba6e5df2df68a458218be7104?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd0cac2a26433f3f23b23854cd7d9215e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/received_events", "gravatar_id": "968fba3ba6e5df2df68a458218be7104", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jarl-dk", "type": "User", "id": 191521, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f878bd3543c15100b2a1"}, "id": 9123592, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7835"}
