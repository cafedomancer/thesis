Really?\n\nThreadsafe being on by default will mean bugs get caught sooner, performances issues from eagerly (or safely) loading libraries must be addressed, and there's no surprises when someone runs threadsafe on JRuby or Rubinius. There are now more implementations with parallel threads than there are GIL implementations. Perhaps it's time for thread safety to become the norm for Rails and all of Rubydom.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c6e8"}, "issue_id": 6685, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6251308", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6251308", "updated_at": "2012-06-11T17:56:13Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius", "login": "headius", "gravatar_id": "f1d37642fdaa1662ff46e4c65731e9ab", "html_url": "https://github.com/headius", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f1d37642fdaa1662ff46e4c65731e9ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F36bedb6eb7152f39b16328448942822b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 10135, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-11T17:56:13Z", "id": 6251308, "owner": "rails"}
