The idea was to make those simple cases even simpler because I find myself writing the simple cases often enough. :-)\r\n\r\nI didn't think about this at the time, but I think doing something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<%= unordered_list @items do |item| %>\r\n  <%= markup_for_item %>\r\n  <%= more_markup_for_item %>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould be a good use case for this \u2014 unfortunately in it's current form, it won't do that so I'd have to keep going with it. I just thought it'd be a good idea to get rid of some of the repetition of writing loops over collections.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Okay, I lied. The above code totally works. I had a typo in my view code. :-)", "_id": {"$oid": "523814dbbd3543c15100dc5f"}, "issue_id": 5637, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4769804", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5637#issuecomment-4769804", "updated_at": "2012-03-28T16:38:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jgaskins/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jgaskins/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jgaskins/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jgaskins/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jgaskins", "login": "jgaskins", "gravatar_id": "76de16cb97b382f990c4798277e37bab", "html_url": "https://github.com/jgaskins", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jgaskins/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jgaskins/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jgaskins/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/76de16cb97b382f990c4798277e37bab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9c5c4e222cf0d433d1b31c1007554a5d.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jgaskins/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 108205, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jgaskins/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-28T16:36:11Z", "id": 4769804, "owner": "rails"}
