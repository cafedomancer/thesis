If you read the thread top-bottom I think I have been always respectful.\r\n\r\nBut people assume that *not* applying a pull request is being defensive, or not listening to your users.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened here is that I have explained very patiently and respectfully why the predicate was written that way. And  I have no doubt about what I did.\r\n\r\nYou may differ, and that's fine. Even when I closed this PR I said some people may think different, and that's fine. But I am totally certain that the patch was correct and breaking no contract. That's being sure about one's rationale behind a code change, which is different from listening or not listening to users. \r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e24c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4672741"}
