If you read the thread top-bottom I think I have been always respectful.\r\n\r\nBut people assume that *not* applying a pull request is being defensive, or not listening to your users.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened here is that I have explained very patiently and respectfully why the predicate was written that way. And  I have no doubt about what I did.\r\n\r\nYou may differ, and that's fine. Even when I closed this PR I said some people may think different, and that's fine. But I am totally certain that the patch was correct and breaking no contract. That's being sure about one's rationale behind a code change, which is different from listening or not listening to users. \r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e24c"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4672741", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4672741", "updated_at": "2012-03-24T10:15:26Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-24T10:15:26Z", "id": 4672741, "owner": "rails"}
