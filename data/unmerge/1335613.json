Even though it explicitly states in its Railtie that it wants to run after Finisher's :set_routes_reloader initializer, it seems to work fine with my patch that always places it before the Finisher. I'll report it in their repo.\r\n\r\nStill, the issue with :after_initialize remains. There should be more constraints on :finisher_hook so that other initializers can't push it down. \r\n\r\nAnd is :after_initialize really a good name for this hook? It's misleading since it's not guaranteed to run after all initializers. At very least :set_routes_reloader and :disable_dependency_loading initializers from Finisher run after the hooks. Moreover, it's possible for an initializer to request to be run after :finisher_hook. This can be a source or errors (as this issue clearly shows). \r\n\r\nOr maybe :after_initialize would better not be executed by an initializer?", "_id": {"$oid": "52385308bd3543c1510118b2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1602#issuecomment-1335613"}
