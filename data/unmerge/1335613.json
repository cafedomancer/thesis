{"body": "Right, it might be better for Cells to use :after_initialize hook rather than initializers. Even though it explicitly states in its Railtie that it wants to run after Finisher's :set_routes_reloader initializer, it seems to work fine with my patch that always places it before the Finisher. I'll report it in their repo.\r\n\r\nStill, the issue with :after_initialize remains. There should be more constraints on :finisher_hook so that other initializers can't push it down. \r\n\r\nAnd is :after_initialize really a good name for this hook? It's misleading since it's not guaranteed to run after all initializers. At very least :set_routes_reloader and :disable_dependency_loading initializers from Finisher run after the hooks. Moreover, it's possible for an initializer to request to be run after :finisher_hook. This can be a source or errors (as this issue clearly shows). \r\n\r\nOr maybe :after_initialize would better not be executed by an initializer?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1335613", "created_at": "2011-06-09T17:01:56Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1602#issuecomment-1335613", "updated_at": "2011-06-09T17:01:56Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 1602, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/cameel", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/865192faed17824a4060b9345e9a5bf9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F19130826b881c93bb0814569e45ca8a9.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/received_events", "gravatar_id": "865192faed17824a4060b9345e9a5bf9", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "cameel", "type": "User", "id": 137030, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52385308bd3543c1510118b2"}, "id": 1335613, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1602"}
