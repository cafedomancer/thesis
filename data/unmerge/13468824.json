The workaround is sufficient for my needs, and I'll run an assets:clean when I need to. :-)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13468824", "created_at": "2013-02-13T00:53:04Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9205#issuecomment-13468824", "updated_at": "2013-02-13T00:53:04Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9205, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/sj26", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/93a69a78c59a3219aa5d26fd612fd667?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F097a266326991a991c77d203160c8563.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/received_events", "gravatar_id": "93a69a78c59a3219aa5d26fd612fd667", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "sj26", "type": "User", "id": 14028, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ec2abd3543c151009c76"}, "id": 13468824, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9205"}
