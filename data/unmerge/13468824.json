The fundamental problem seems to be that 1 rails environment == 2 sprockets environments, and there's no cache namespacing for that. A sprockets environment config fingerprint prefix would be better, though, so switching compressors/digests/etc would also implicitly invalidate the cache.\r\n\r\nCe la vie. The workaround is sufficient for my needs, and I'll run an assets:clean when I need to. :-)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ec2abd3543c151009c76"}, "issue_id": 9205, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13468824", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9205#issuecomment-13468824", "updated_at": "2013-02-13T00:53:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26", "login": "sj26", "gravatar_id": "93a69a78c59a3219aa5d26fd612fd667", "html_url": "https://github.com/sj26", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/93a69a78c59a3219aa5d26fd612fd667?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F097a266326991a991c77d203160c8563.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 14028, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sj26/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-13T00:53:04Z", "id": 13468824, "owner": "rails"}
