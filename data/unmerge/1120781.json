Of course if something goes wrong in your signal handler you end up getting Thread#killed again.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this isn't a solution for Thread#raise at all, only Thread#kill.\r\n\r\nThirdly and most importantly, this makes sure you will NEVER get a partially committed transaction due to a Thread#kill.  Doesn't matter where the interpreter is when it's called.  Of course, this is only true on 1.8 and Rubinius unless the others also change their thread status behavior (which I think they probably should).", "_id": {"$oid": "52386109bd3543c1510122ec"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/382#issuecomment-1120781"}
