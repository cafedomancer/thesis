{"body": "K so firstly I did mention that a signal handler is what you should do and mitigates the issue.  Of course if something goes wrong in your signal handler you end up getting Thread#killed again.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this isn't a solution for Thread#raise at all, only Thread#kill.\r\n\r\nThirdly and most importantly, this makes sure you will NEVER get a partially committed transaction due to a Thread#kill.  Doesn't matter where the interpreter is when it's called.  Of course, this is only true on 1.8 and Rubinius unless the others also change their thread status behavior (which I think they probably should).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1120781", "created_at": "2011-05-09T01:09:35Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/382#issuecomment-1120781", "updated_at": "2011-05-09T01:09:35Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 382, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/coderrr/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/coderrr/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/coderrr/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/coderrr", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/coderrr/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/coderrr", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/coderrr/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/af4ce9309f8c4f7fc5cb33e7a5b08c64?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F5249ee8e0cff02ad6b4cc0ee0e50b7d1.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/coderrr/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/coderrr/received_events", "gravatar_id": "af4ce9309f8c4f7fc5cb33e7a5b08c64", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/coderrr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "coderrr", "type": "User", "id": 2200, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/coderrr/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386109bd3543c1510122ec"}, "id": 1120781, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/382"}
