{"body": "Just fought with this leak myself, happy to see this in play.  The approach I took was to add the below to the teardown_fixtures method in fixtures.rb, which seems consistent with the original callbacks commit ( https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b07073924002fd56ac5b63b24cb9318b3dee45c4 ) and should allow for the actual rollback callbacks to take effect in tests (for, e.g., cleanup of external references if any, etc.).
