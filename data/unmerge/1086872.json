{"body": "The file is right. Just the version is old. Check this out - https://github.com/rails/rails/commits/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/array/access.rb - the history of the file. There are 3 changes done in the last 5 days, after Dec 2009. \n\nI see that you've forked the rails repo in March and so your clone will not have these new changes until you pull the upstream changes. To do that, follow these steps:\n\nIn your cloned repo, type the command, \"git remote add upstream git@github.com:rails/rails.git\". And then, \"git pull upstream master\". This will pull in all the changes done on the rails repo. Work on top of these files always.
