{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6488", "repo": "rails", "body": "Okay, I _think_ i understand the fairness issue, and it seems pretty damn good. Def understand the issue where it's unpredictable which thread will get the lock first -- that's what requires the `@num_waiting` in the first place. And I understand how that guards against a thread that wasn't waiting at all 'stealing' a connection from one that was. (Yes, I have had this problem too). \n\nI _think_ I'm understanding right that your code will be _pretty close_ to fair --  if there are multiple threads waiting, there's no way the oldest thread waiting will get _continually_ bumped in favor of newer waiters.  The issue is only when N>1 threads are checked in at _very close_ to the same time, and even then the first N waiters will all get connections before the N+1st and subsequent waiters.  That seems totally good enough. \n\nOn the reaper.... man, looking at the mysql2 adapter code specifically, I don't think the reaper will ever reap anything, i can't figure out how a connection could ever not be `active?` _even if_ the rdbms has closed it for idleness -- `active?` is implemented adapter-specific, but in `mysql2` it seems to me a connection will _always_ be `active?` unless manually `disconnect`ed. \n\nThat's really a different issue and for @tenderlove to consider I guess, since he added the code. Personally, I would not ever use the reaper at all, which fortunately is easy to do by making sure `reap_frequency` is unset.
