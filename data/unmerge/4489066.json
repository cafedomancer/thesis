And you can always use something like this instead of wrapping in if/unless:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n  <% cache [ @user, 'form' ] do %>\r\n    ...\r\n  <% end unless @user.changed? %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that the `:if / :unless` options wouldn't help that much in that example of `unless/else` you've used, so normal ruby should win in this case, right?
