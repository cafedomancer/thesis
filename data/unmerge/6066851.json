I ran into errors trying to monkey patch the parse_query method but your way seems to work.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/2854095\n\nIt would be great to see your patch merged into the stable branch and maybe's its a good reason for one last point release. The stable branch has a few other post-2.3.14 changes anyway.\n\nThanks everyone.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238066abd3543c15100c8e8"}, "issue_id": 6580, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6066851", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6580#issuecomment-6066851", "updated_at": "2012-06-02T13:11:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boone/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boone/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boone/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boone/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/boone", "login": "boone", "gravatar_id": "704ebf01816fa24abf8ee33c75c344de", "html_url": "https://github.com/boone", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boone/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boone/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boone/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/704ebf01816fa24abf8ee33c75c344de?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb0ba5c44aaf65f6ca34cf116e6d82ebf.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boone/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6807, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boone/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-01T18:12:12Z", "id": 6066851, "owner": "rails"}
