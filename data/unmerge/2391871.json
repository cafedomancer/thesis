But I can be wrong. Maybe it's a point that need some explanation in the docs.\r\nAnd if it means disabling the use of an existing manifest, it should be stated somewhere that it is incompatible with `compile = false`.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I wanted to disable fingerprinting in my app so that my front-end developer contractor (i.e. no ruby stack) could copy assets and play with it without file naming issues.", "_id": {"$oid": "523837cfbd3543c15100fecd"}, "issue_id": 3311, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2391871", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3311#issuecomment-2391871", "updated_at": "2011-10-13T07:06:18Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bbenezech/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bbenezech/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bbenezech/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bbenezech/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bbenezech", "login": "bbenezech", "gravatar_id": "c1607873b99845b2cd53f8634860d4d4", "html_url": "https://github.com/bbenezech", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bbenezech/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bbenezech/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bbenezech/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/c1607873b99845b2cd53f8634860d4d4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3af65294001defdf7d60d4b9e3151fff.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bbenezech/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26794, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bbenezech/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-10-13T07:06:18Z", "id": 2391871, "owner": "rails"}
