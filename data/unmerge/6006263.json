Pry is not that popular as it *should* be. Thus, for me, making it default is as good as adding coffee years ago :) Agreed or no?", "_id": {"$oid": "523806b2bd3543c15100c987"}, "issue_id": 6549, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6006263", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6549#issuecomment-6006263", "updated_at": "2012-05-30T10:02:52Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov", "login": "homakov", "gravatar_id": "d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d", "html_url": "https://github.com/homakov", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc1464ded796adc7ac65355e3cc0df165.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 174693, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-30T10:02:52Z", "id": 6006263, "owner": "rails"}
