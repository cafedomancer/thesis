I think this is a big security issue.\r\nThere should definitely be some method treat_as_api or the like, because it's unclear how to make your API secure.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I solved it like this:\r\nclass Api::V1::BaseApiController < ApplicationController\r\n  protect_from_forgery with: :null_session\r\nend\r\n\r\nIs this a good approach?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ea3ebd3543c151009989"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9405#issuecomment-22625557"}
