I can't say what's faster or not, since I have never used `rand()` with anything in a large dataset yet. My thought is that it'd be faster by being a \"native\" function and would perform only one database query instead of `count + offset.first`. Anyway, I can't say for sure, it's just what I have in mind, so getting some numbers on that  matter would be good.\n\nI agree with @dmathieu, it's basically what I tried to exemplify before, unfortunately `random` only does not solve great part of the needs. And random order I believe is usually database specific, or not?", "_id": {"$oid": "523800f4bd3543c15100c094"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7001#issuecomment-6831679"}
