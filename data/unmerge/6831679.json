I can't say what's faster or not, since I have never used `rand()` with anything in a large dataset yet. My thought is that it'd be faster by being a \"native\" function and would perform only one database query instead of `count + offset.first`. Anyway, I can't say for sure, it's just what I have in mind, so getting some numbers on that  matter would be good.\n\nI agree with @dmathieu, it's basically what I tried to exemplify before, unfortunately `random` only does not solve great part of the needs. And random order I believe is usually database specific, or not?", "_id": {"$oid": "523800f4bd3543c15100c094"}, "issue_id": 7001, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6831679", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7001#issuecomment-6831679", "updated_at": "2012-07-08T14:33:46Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-08T14:33:46Z", "id": 6831679, "owner": "rails"}
