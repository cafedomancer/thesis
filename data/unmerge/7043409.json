{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7075", "repo": "rails", "body": "I find the name `unique_messages` to be confusing. Alternatives are `joint_messages` or `messages_sentence` although they are not good too.\n\nI also find the `unique_message` API to be poor. There is no need to pass the messages as argument, as you can retrieve it from the attribute name. The helper in its current state should be marked as private IMO.\n\nAlso, your tests do not ensure that calling `unique_messages(attribute)` would return nil, as your `errors_on` method showed above (there isn't even a `unique_messages(attribute)` API).\n\nFinally, there is no need to call `to_hash.map`. Just `map` should be fine and faster.\n\nThanks for your contributions.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380010bd3543c15100bf20"}, "issue_id": 7075, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7043409", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7075#issuecomment-7043409", "updated_at": "2012-07-17T17:53:10Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-17T17:53:10Z", "id": 7043409, "owner": "rails"}
