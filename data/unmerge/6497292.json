By using fewer processes with fewer heaps that the GC can be more efficient about managing, you will reduce CPU utilization as well.\n\n@kenn are you seriously arguing that a process is the same weight as a pthread? That is not true whatsoever. I don't know how many workers you are running relative to your number of CPUs, but we can't run 100 processes per server with REE, even on servers with 16 CPU cores. Beyond just memory usage, CPU utilization (largely due to the garbage collector) is too high, and we see higher throughput by reducing the number of processes.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c72f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6497292"}
