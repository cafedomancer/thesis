I knew i had forgotten something. i18n it is. \n\nSometimes, you want to show all errors for a give attribute on your view. To not iterate on errors on the view, you can just create a helper for it like:\n\n```ruby\n def errors_on(object, attribute, full_message=false)\n   return if object.errors[attribute].empty?\n   errors = object.errors[attribute].join(\" and \") #i18n :grin:\n   errors = attribute.to_s + \" \" + errors if full_message\n   errors\n end\n```\n\nThis helper will show the errors only if there are at least one, otherwise, it will print nothing.\n\nWith this method, no helper will be necessary at all. Just call unique_messages(attribute) on errors.\n\nThis kind of stuff is necessary when you want to show the validation errors right next to the input field instead of the rails default. It is kind of out of rails scope since its not the default behavior, but i think it worth a shot. =D\n\nI will make the i18n changes and commit when i finish it.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380010bd3543c15100bf1f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7075#issuecomment-7040713"}
