Keys like :class are frequently used on helpers that offer a html_options hash argument, but this argument generally is used to define attributes for a single element, which is not the case of flash_elements, as it can render many block elements, one for each message stored on flash.\r\n2. I really like this kind of interface. :)\r\n\r\nBut of course, I can change the interface if most people prefer keys like :class and :tag.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383c0fbd3543c151010379"}, "issue_id": 3009, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2097924", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3009#issuecomment-2097924", "updated_at": "2011-09-14T20:49:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns", "login": "elomarns", "gravatar_id": "df23382db80111520deb86d46a47f70f", "html_url": "https://github.com/elomarns", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/df23382db80111520deb86d46a47f70f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2bec63f5d312303621583b97ff7c68bf.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 13167, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-09-14T20:49:51Z", "id": 2097924, "owner": "rails"}
