Keys like :class are frequently used on helpers that offer a html_options hash argument, but this argument generally is used to define attributes for a single element, which is not the case of flash_elements, as it can render many block elements, one for each message stored on flash.\r\n2. I really like this kind of interface. :)\r\n\r\nBut of course, I can change the interface if most people prefer keys like :class and :tag.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383c0fbd3543c151010379"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3009#issuecomment-2097924"}
