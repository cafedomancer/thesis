{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6941", "repo": "rails", "body": "That's weird. Since you require the \"asset\" gem explicitly in `lib/foo/engine.rb`, `Bundler.require` shouldn't even be necessary. Are you sure you're requiring `foo/engine` somewhere?\n\nKeep in mind that .gemspec files don't support Bundler-like groups. Using `Bundler.require` inside test/dummy can only give you a false sense of confidence that your engine is working properly (since Bundler is looking at your engine's Gemfile), but may fail downstream (since Bundler is looking at downstream's Gemfile, and **its** \"assets\" group).\n\nThe best I could come up with, was to mimic the behaviour of `Bundler.require` in my `lib/foo.rb`:\n\n```ruby\n# most gems\n# ...\nrequire 'will_paginate'\n\n# \"asset\" gems\nif Rails.groups('assets' => %w[ development test ]).include?('assets')\n  require 'asset_sync'\n  require 'compass-rails'\n  require 'fancy-buttons'\n  require 'oily_png'\n  require 'sass-rails'\n  require 'uglifier'\nend\n```\n\nAll in all, I think I'm against this patch, since it can amplify the misconception that it's a good idea to group gem dependencies inside your gem's Gemfile and let Bundler require them.", "_id": {"$oid": "523801b7bd3543c15100c1be"}, "issue_id": 6941, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6752519", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6941#issuecomment-6752519", "updated_at": "2012-07-04T04:50:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva", "login": "exviva", "gravatar_id": "56c0f984e7a1cccbd5ea165ef310ba4f", "html_url": "https://github.com/exviva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/56c0f984e7a1cccbd5ea165ef310ba4f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa77d299ee00dfee2de17de8fcd02c69a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 80070, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/exviva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-04T04:50:27Z", "id": 6752519, "owner": "rails"}
