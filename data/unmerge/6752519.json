Since you require the \"asset\" gem explicitly in `lib/foo/engine.rb`, `Bundler.require` shouldn't even be necessary. Are you sure you're requiring `foo/engine` somewhere?\n\nKeep in mind that .gemspec files don't support Bundler-like groups. Using `Bundler.require` inside test/dummy can only give you a false sense of confidence that your engine is working properly (since Bundler is looking at your engine's Gemfile), but may fail downstream (since Bundler is looking at downstream's Gemfile, and **its** \"assets\" group).\n\nThe best I could come up with, was to mimic the behaviour of `Bundler.require` in my `lib/foo.rb`:\n\n```ruby\n# most gems\n# ...\nrequire 'will_paginate'\n\n# \"asset\" gems\nif Rails.groups('assets' => %w[ development test ]).include?('assets')\n  require 'asset_sync'\n  require 'compass-rails'\n  require 'fancy-buttons'\n  require 'oily_png'\n  require 'sass-rails'\n  require 'uglifier'\nend\n```\n\nAll in all, I think I'm against this patch, since it can amplify the misconception that it's a good idea to group gem dependencies inside your gem's Gemfile and let Bundler require them.", "_id": {"$oid": "523801b7bd3543c15100c1be"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6941#issuecomment-6752519"}
