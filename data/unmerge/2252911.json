That's where we differ (since we can't possibly measure it).\r\n\r\nThe fact that someone has 60 assets and considers that to be slow even against localhost... for that one I want to provide a configurable flag, but it is a particular case that does not justify the default in itself in my view.\r\n\r\nIn all these years almost everyone had the equivalent to :debug => true in dev mode. Because :cache => true was ignored by default. I have not perceived that as a pain point for a majority of users so far. It is the only \"measure\" I have in mind.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you turn this off by default, better watch out :debug => true from being accidentally committed.", "_id": {"$oid": "523839bebd3543c151010111"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3180#issuecomment-2252911"}
