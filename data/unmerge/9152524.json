{"body": "Regardnig `:prefix =>` versus `:units =>` (the name of the option): I would actually argue that it should stay as `:prefix` because the unit is in all three cases bytes. The difference is actually the prefix system, whether it is a binary customary prefix system or binary ISO prefix system, or whether it is SI prefix system. So I hope it will stay as `:prefix`. Anyway it should stay that way right now due to API stabilisation.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9152524", "created_at": "2012-10-04T18:48:53Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7835#issuecomment-9152524", "updated_at": "2012-10-04T18:48:53Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7835, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jarl-dk", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/968fba3ba6e5df2df68a458218be7104?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd0cac2a26433f3f23b23854cd7d9215e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/received_events", "gravatar_id": "968fba3ba6e5df2df68a458218be7104", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jarl-dk", "type": "User", "id": 191521, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f879bd3543c15100b2a6"}, "id": 9152524, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7835"}
