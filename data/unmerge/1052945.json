{"body": "I like the idea, and the resulting code is extremely clean and easy to read, but I think that this might be too similar to existing features.  Here are two alternatives that work in Rails 3 today that are more flexible because they aren't tied to the format validator and are still one-liners in your model code.  I'm not saying these are any better, but in my experience my apps rarely accumulate too many format validators to deal with and most of the formats are limited to a single model so there's no need to factor them out.  That's just my limited experience though.\r\n\r\nHere's one way to do it:\r\n\r\n    class TitleValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator\r\n      def validate_each(record, attribute, value)\r\n        record.errors[attribute] << 'is not a valid e-mail address' unless your_method_to_test_email_address(value)\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    class Person < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n      validates :email_address, :presence => true, :title => true\r\n    end\r\n\r\nHere's another way to do it:\r\n\r\n    class Person < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n      validates_format_of :email_address, :with => YOUR_EMAIL_REGEX\r\n    end", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1052945", "created_at": "2011-04-25T13:47:21Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/259#issuecomment-1052945", "updated_at": "2011-04-25T13:47:21Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 259, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/MDaubs", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e9b949c8749222225501c99e8e8ad9ff?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa71c1d3324103addc6c422fa5e374d6f.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e9b949c8749222225501c99e8e8ad9ff", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "MDaubs", "type": "User", "id": 127900, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386419bd3543c151012571"}, "id": 1052945, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/259"}
