{"body": "@davidcelis we have changed some inflections which were clearly wrong for Rails 4 keeping backwards compatibility. We basically ran the rules against your computer dictionary, saw that it made more \"damage\" than fix a problem, so we added a new rule but added irregular inflections for the previous cases.\n\nIf you believe that there are still similar rules, please open a pull request for such rules, run them against a dictionary and let's see how we can move on from there. Yes, we will still get some cases wrong (like `cow`) but we need to know how it compares against the general rule. It is not worthy to add an inflection for cows, the 5 developers building farmer apps can add the inflection on their own.\n\nI am closing this because the issues tracker is not the proper place to discuss a feature and we already agreed the current proposal is no good. We can continue it over the mailing list.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7058476", "created_at": "2012-07-18T07:13:59Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7071#issuecomment-7058476", "updated_at": "2012-07-18T07:13:59Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7071, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380016bd3543c15100bf41"}, "id": 7058476, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7071"}
