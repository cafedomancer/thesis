We basically ran the rules against your computer dictionary, saw that it made more \"damage\" than fix a problem, so we added a new rule but added irregular inflections for the previous cases.\n\nIf you believe that there are still similar rules, please open a pull request for such rules, run them against a dictionary and let's see how we can move on from there. Yes, we will still get some cases wrong (like `cow`) but we need to know how it compares against the general rule. It is not worthy to add an inflection for cows, the 5 developers building farmer apps can add the inflection on their own.\n\nI am closing this because the issues tracker is not the proper place to discuss a feature and we already agreed the current proposal is no good. We can continue it over the mailing list.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380016bd3543c15100bf41"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7071#issuecomment-7058476"}
