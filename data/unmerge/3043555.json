From what I've heard on the street, Valium is invaluable for \"I need to collect a bunch of IDs to use in a WHERE x IN (...)\" clause, where there's no good way to do the whole query in Arel without instantiating all the objects.  In fact, I'm not sure #1 and #2 are separate use cases; you start with `User.map(&:email)` to see if it gets you in the right direction, and you end up three `has_many :through` later, caching the foreign keys so you can get back into Arel-world.\r\n\r\nI haven't followed the serializer stuff yet, but if that is moving toward \"column of Postgres type X should really instantiate Rubjy objjects of type X1 like so\"... that seems nirvana-like.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f63c"}, "issue_id": 3871, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3043555", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3043555", "updated_at": "2011-12-07T05:38:26Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaylevitt/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaylevitt/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaylevitt/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaylevitt/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaylevitt", "login": "jaylevitt", "gravatar_id": "b8aca816cb8646a855175f64bdfa2838", "html_url": "https://github.com/jaylevitt", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaylevitt/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaylevitt/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaylevitt/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b8aca816cb8646a855175f64bdfa2838?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc99e757a469e0631c1a61e97949885f1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaylevitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 11246, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaylevitt/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-07T05:38:26Z", "id": 3043555, "owner": "rails"}
