Wait.  As someone who uses Valium every day on the job... hmm.  From what I've heard on the street, Valium is invaluable for \"I need to collect a bunch of IDs to use in a WHERE x IN (...)\" clause, where there's no good way to do the whole query in Arel without instantiating all the objects.  In fact, I'm not sure #1 and #2 are separate use cases; you start with `User.map(&:email)` to see if it gets you in the right direction, and you end up three `has_many :through` later, caching the foreign keys so you can get back into Arel-world.\r\n\r\nI haven't followed the serializer stuff yet, but if that is moving toward \"column of Postgres type X should really instantiate Rubjy objjects of type X1 like so\"... that seems nirvana-like.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f63c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3043555"}
