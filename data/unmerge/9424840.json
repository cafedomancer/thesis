The problem is the shorthand is normalized in `Mapping`  using the full path whereas it should be using the current module from the scope and only deriving the additional controller/action details from the last segment passed to `match`, etc.\r\n\r\nWe either need to fix it so match shorthand syntax works everywhere or deprecate it.", "_id": {"$oid": "523dbd16bd354364b90098b7"}, "issue_id": 7944, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9424840", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7944#issuecomment-9424840", "updated_at": "2012-10-14T19:33:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-14T19:33:27Z", "id": 9424840, "owner": "rails"}
