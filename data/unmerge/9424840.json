The problem is the shorthand is normalized in `Mapping`  using the full path whereas it should be using the current module from the scope and only deriving the additional controller/action details from the last segment passed to `match`, etc.\r\n\r\nWe either need to fix it so match shorthand syntax works everywhere or deprecate it.", "_id": {"$oid": "523dbd16bd354364b90098b7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7944#issuecomment-9424840"}
