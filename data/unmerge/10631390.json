So i would say there will be a lot of least code, especially in the situation once the model is big. Preferably, i want to avoid that as much as possible. On top of it, it looks quite hackish to me. That is why i wanted to have something more general and light weighted.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e00c7bd354364b900c486"}, "issue_id": 7221, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10631390", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7221#issuecomment-10631390", "updated_at": "2012-11-22T11:24:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kot-begemot/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kot-begemot/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kot-begemot/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kot-begemot/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kot-begemot", "login": "kot-begemot", "gravatar_id": "2a3e5e19a0d90edfd4eb094385f6617a", "html_url": "https://github.com/kot-begemot", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kot-begemot/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kot-begemot/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kot-begemot/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2a3e5e19a0d90edfd4eb094385f6617a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F72d2c4e579aecaaf57d87d6406614584.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kot-begemot/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 780077, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kot-begemot/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-22T11:22:50Z", "id": 10631390, "owner": "rails"}
