This sounds appealing, as you don't have to make any modifications to MessageVerifier.  However, what about the following downsides:\r\n\r\n* If you embed the expiry into the serialized data then you are required to deserialize to check expiry.  If you keep it separate you can check expiry first and not bother with needless deserialization.\r\n* It would seem there would be a small, though probably negligible, chance that this format could be misinterpreted upon deserialization.  What if a permanent signed cookie has a deserialized object that matches `{_expires: int, value: value}`.  How would you distinguish a legacy permanent cookie from from a perishable one?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d81cbd3543c151008449"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11168#issuecomment-20716787"}
