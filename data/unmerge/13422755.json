{"body": "@graysonwright I'm not sure if there is an exact criteria, but my opinion is that the framework should do the hard stuff for you, and leave the easy stuff to you.\r\n\r\nOther thing for this specific case is that pluralize method should do only one thing - pluralization. If I want html tag wrapping I would introduce another method like `pluralize_with_wrap`. But since it's so easy to write that helper myself, it's best to prevent the framework from getting bloated and keep it easy to maintain. ;)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13422755", "created_at": "2013-02-12T08:38:51Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5490#issuecomment-13422755", "updated_at": "2013-02-12T08:38:51Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5490, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/dalibor", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/5d0be7db35e8c5d24a0b63f4de463430?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F013154403b9d27634b2ce368eadbe1ca.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/received_events", "gravatar_id": "5d0be7db35e8c5d24a0b63f4de463430", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "dalibor", "type": "User", "id": 48384, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ebd11bd354364b901265e"}, "id": 13422755, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5490"}
