If I want html tag wrapping I would introduce another method like `pluralize_with_wrap`. But since it's so easy to write that helper myself, it's best to prevent the framework from getting bloated and keep it easy to maintain. ;)", "_id": {"$oid": "523ebd11bd354364b901265e"}, "issue_id": 5490, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13422755", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5490#issuecomment-13422755", "updated_at": "2013-02-12T08:38:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor", "login": "dalibor", "gravatar_id": "5d0be7db35e8c5d24a0b63f4de463430", "html_url": "https://github.com/dalibor", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/5d0be7db35e8c5d24a0b63f4de463430?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F013154403b9d27634b2ce368eadbe1ca.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 48384, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dalibor/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-12T08:38:51Z", "id": 13422755, "owner": "rails"}
