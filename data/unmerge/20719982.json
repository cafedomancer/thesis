If the application had two cookies, one of which was a normal signed cookie and entirely controlled by the attacker, and the other of which was a expiring signed cookie that wasn't controlled by the attacker. He could modify the cookie that he controls to look like an expiring signed cookie. He could then take that cookie and replace the actual expiring signed cookie with the spoofed one in the browser. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of ifs and buts in that scenario, and it is really more of an issue with the fact that signed cookie values can be swapped between cookies. That issue should probably be addressed separately because it *does* pose a moderate risk for any app that has multiple, similarly formatted, signed cookies.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d81cbd3543c151008452"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11168#issuecomment-20719982"}
