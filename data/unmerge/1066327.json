So if you use a key from the constant hash like in my example, you'll get a frozen string error.  That's pretty confusing, because you don't expect the strings you pass to get/post/put/etc to get modified. In order to get the above example to work with the current code, you have to dup the key that you're passing in...", "_id": {"$oid": "5238663dbd3543c1510127b2"}, "issue_id": 185, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1066327", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/185#issuecomment-1066327", "updated_at": "2011-04-27T19:53:00Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo", "login": "misfo", "gravatar_id": "cee19a4eb998343e677f7f1cfd4de5bb", "html_url": "https://github.com/misfo", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cee19a4eb998343e677f7f1cfd4de5bb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F03300a14fb9934cc5c613e26bdfbaab8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 40791, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-27T19:53:00Z", "id": 1066327, "owner": "rails"}
