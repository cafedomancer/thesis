But it's really not a big deal, because git bundles are cached after the first download. The Rails maintainers have been generous and patient (i.e. true heroes) to backport security fixes to such an old branch. If that changes, a fork may be necessary, but my hope is that https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/2-3-stable remains the best one.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ee64bd3543c151009f7d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8948#issuecomment-12560846"}
