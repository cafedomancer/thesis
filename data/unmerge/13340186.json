{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5490", "repo": "rails", "body": "Could we revisit this topic?\r\n\r\nThis seems like a very light commit, with only one SLOC changed, and I believe that it fixes functionality that is now very limited. \r\n\r\nThe pluralize method takes a number and a string, and returns only a string -- once you call the method, you constrain yourself to working with a string from that point forward. If you want to further manipulate the word or the number, the method becomes useless to you.\r\n\r\nThe use case of tagging the number and word separately came up. For example, if you want to manipulate the number with styling, as in this image:\r\n![tagged_numbers](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/829576/142634/9f2a8e2c-7306-11e2-87a7-fe03e553c476.jpg)\r\n\r\nsomething like the following must currently be done:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<span class='number-emph'>\r\n  <%= @user.projects.count %>\r\n</span><br/>\r\n<%= @user.projects.one? 'Project' : 'Projects' %>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last line -- checking to see if the count is one, then selecting a version of a word to match, is *almost exactly* what's being done in the pluralize method already -- it makes sense to expand the method to include this use case.\r\n\r\nManipulating the page with javascript, or scraping pages for data is also made a lot easier by being able to tag the word and number separately.\r\n\r\nThe method becomes much more effective and powerful when you have the option of simply transforming the word to match the count, instead of being forced to concatenate the two into a string.", "_id": {"$oid": "523ebd11bd354364b901265b"}, "issue_id": 5490, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13340186", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5490#issuecomment-13340186", "updated_at": "2013-02-09T22:40:09Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graysonwright/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graysonwright/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graysonwright/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graysonwright/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/graysonwright", "login": "graysonwright", "gravatar_id": "6a2e183a609cf77e2b7078bd6767f262", "html_url": "https://github.com/graysonwright", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graysonwright/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graysonwright/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graysonwright/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/6a2e183a609cf77e2b7078bd6767f262?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fae21d010843a977b79afc76bbed88b3c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graysonwright/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 829576, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/graysonwright/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-09T22:38:06Z", "id": 13340186, "owner": "rails"}
