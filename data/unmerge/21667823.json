Are you happy with the commit message?\r\n\r\nIf everythings OK I'll update the PR.\r\n\r\nWhat I did:\r\n- rebased my branch\r\n- cherry-picked your two commits\r\n- added the changelog entry for the fix\r\n- squashed all the changes into one commit.\r\n\r\nI made two minor changes in the test flle:\r\n- renamed `new_update_and_destroy_bird_attributes` to `update_new_and_destroy_bird_attributes`, since it reflects the order of the attributes. (The order matters,when one tries alternative fixes.)\r\n- renamed the test assigning the `destroy_bird_attributes` to have `destroy` in the title rather than `deletion`\r\n\r\nI get one regression failure running `rake test_sqlite3`, which is probably due to my sqlite3-version being 3.6.20:\r\n\r\n> ActiveRecord::AdapterTest#test_uniqueness_violations_are_translated_to_specific_exception [rails/activerecord/test/cases/adapter_test.rb:141]:\r\n> [ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique] exception expected, not\r\n> Class: <ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid>\r\n> Message: <\"SQLite3::ConstraintException: constraint failed: INSERT INTO subscribers(nick) VALUES('me')\">\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523ec1f2bd354364b901272b"}, "issue_id": 5476, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/21667823", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5476#issuecomment-21667823", "updated_at": "2013-07-27T16:08:18Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tandem-softworks/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tandem-softworks/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tandem-softworks/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tandem-softworks/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tandem-softworks", "login": "tandem-softworks", "gravatar_id": "34a16f98f4ba99dcb241c8ddb3a5446c", "html_url": "https://github.com/tandem-softworks", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tandem-softworks/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tandem-softworks/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tandem-softworks/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/34a16f98f4ba99dcb241c8ddb3a5446c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F1da9a1d31a36bd743246c9900650b600.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tandem-softworks/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1497057, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tandem-softworks/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-27T16:08:18Z", "id": 21667823, "owner": "rails"}
