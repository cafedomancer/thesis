Last I looked (3 months ago) the digest authentication problem was still there in the most recent rails.\n\nI think it would be best for somebody else to look at the code and understand the problem - anybody who is running a service requiring digest authentication where there is any URL rewriting going on (load balancing, proxying) will run into this as it rails is using an incorrect implementation of the RFC.", "_id": {"$oid": "523844c0bd3543c151010d64"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2323#issuecomment-7464742"}
