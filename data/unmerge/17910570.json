I'm not that knowledgeable about rails code.\r\n2. I'm not sure, it doesn't look relevant to me. The change was introduced in commit 5267addd4f986c89df3d31f35e046abc3b1fbe26. Before, it used to check for methods ```errors``` and ```on?```. The commit has no further explanations. Anyway, errors.include? use only messages. Moreover, I think errors will always respond to include? and messages (they are both defined in the base Error class).\r\n3.
