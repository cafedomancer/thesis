This means that any supporting infrastructure e.g. HTTP client libraries which know they can retry PUT requests on network failure, or generic accelerating proxies that perform a similar function cannot do so on these PATCH requests - even if they are intended idempotently, on the network they aren't.\r\n\r\nFwiw, that kind of argument does not hold up in the same way for the guaranteed fullness of a PUT request, which is exactly my problem with that (over)specification.
