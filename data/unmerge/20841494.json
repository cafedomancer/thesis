{"body": "Yeah, appreciate the effort spent working on this, thanks for it, but I do believe it goes way beyond the scope of the getting started guide.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this guide is to serve as a somewhat brief introduction to the framework. After reading this guide people would ideally have a general idea of what is Rails about, different components, main principles, etc.\r\n\r\nNested attributes are too much for this introduction in my view, you better get first an idea of what is an association at all. And Twitter bootstrap is also non-essential stuff, I agree with Steve in that it would be distracting. Adds nothing to the core goal, but yet the reader has something there to understand. Not worthwhile.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway!", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20841494", "created_at": "2013-07-11T20:54:26Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11404#issuecomment-20841494", "updated_at": "2013-07-11T20:54:26Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 11404, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "fxn", "type": "User", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d532bd3543c1510081a2"}, "id": 20841494, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11404"}
