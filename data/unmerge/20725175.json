What I'm trying to achieve i to use AR to work fine with it. But apart from that specific case, I think it's a good idea to make AR work fine with legacy databases, which very commonly use STI-like data structures as well. \r\nGiven we can customize the name of the column used for STI, it does make sense to have the possibility to customize the STI mapping itself. We could make it easier to migrate to Rails from other systems allowing the two to live together on the same database.
