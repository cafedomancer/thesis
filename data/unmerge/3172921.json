It's not about whether someone's app will break (which we can obviously work around) but about yet-more additional conceptual overhead for users picking up rails.  There's tonnes of books, screencasts and blog posts which show how RESTful routing works and they all say \"put will update\".\r\n\r\nUsers will read those blog posts or books, write `:method=>:put` in their html and get routing errors.\r\n\r\nWe can't just do that for the sake of feeling better about our purity.  I'd suggest we really need a [web-accelerator level of pain](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_web_accelerator_hey_not_so_fast_an_alert_for_web_app_designers.php) to justify changing the defaults.\r\n\r\nHave fun guys ;)\r\n ", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c15101212f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3172921"}
