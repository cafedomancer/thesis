{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10596", "repo": "rails", "body": "> I wonder if similar issues exist in mysql or other databases...\r\n\r\nGood question. This might be the case since [`translate_exception` in the mysql adapters](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_mysql_adapter.rb#L659) call `super` and the `super` implementation is [to raise a `StatementInvalid`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter.rb#L436) exception.\r\n\r\nSeems worth to investigate. To do this I recommend create a test to the MySQL adapters and see if the original exception is raised. WDYT? Want to investigate?\r\n\r\nBTW, thank you so much for your pull request.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dd4dbd3543c151008ad5"}, "issue_id": 10596, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17815909", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10596#issuecomment-17815909", "updated_at": "2013-05-13T14:41:11Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca", "login": "rafaelfranca", "gravatar_id": "0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03", "html_url": "https://github.com/rafaelfranca", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2c7b84fa30f0cea96a90729afe2970a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 47848, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-13T14:41:11Z", "id": 17815909, "owner": "rails"}
