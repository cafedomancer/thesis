This might be the case since [`translate_exception` in the mysql adapters](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_mysql_adapter.rb#L659) call `super` and the `super` implementation is [to raise a `StatementInvalid`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter.rb#L436) exception.\r\n\r\nSeems worth to investigate. To do this I recommend create a test to the MySQL adapters and see if the original exception is raised. WDYT? Want to investigate?\r\n\r\nBTW, thank you so much for your pull request.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dd4dbd3543c151008ad5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10596#issuecomment-17815909"}
