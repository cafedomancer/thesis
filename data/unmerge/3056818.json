I don't think the active support pluck which is already written supports that.  If it does, it must be instantiating, correct?  Otherwise there is no way to run an instance method.\r\n\r\nI vote we should use value_of and values_of and use the functionality of the valerium gem.  I can't speak about the deserialization because I don't know enough of that.\r\n\r\nTo summarize\r\n1. name pluck doesn't make sense because it implies instantiation and pulling value of any method\r\n2. value_of with only 1 field is incomplete, valerium already has values_of, so we should just use those\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f641"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3056818"}
