It should just not add it if it's testing a non-rails app. Here's a diff that does what we need: https://gist.github.com/741ef4123d6e7dacfcf5\n\nIt removes the `remove_const` that I added and refactors the `environment` method to not add the Rails version if the constant isn't defined. Stick it in a PR and I'll merge it.", "_id": {"$oid": "523806aabd3543c15100c974"}, "issue_id": 6552, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6075507", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6552#issuecomment-6075507", "updated_at": "2012-06-02T07:14:49Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-02T07:14:49Z", "id": 6075507, "owner": "rails"}
