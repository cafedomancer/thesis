For instance, how do they know when a model has been injected?\r\n\r\nValidation contexts could be interesting. If, on the other hand, we're not talking about contexts so much as just looking for a nice way to extract and share validations, why not use an `ActiveSupport::Concern`? With the example in the PR:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Autoload model concerns\r\nmodule YourApp\r\n  class Application < Rails::Application\r\n    config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/app/models/concerns)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# app/models/concerns/price_concerns.rb\r\nmodule PriceConcerns\r\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\r\n  \r\n  included do\r\n    validates_presence_of :price\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# app/models/offer.rb\r\nclass Offer < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  include PriceConcerns\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n<3 concerns.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238101dbd3543c15100d60a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6014#issuecomment-5391933"}
