For instance, how do they know when a model has been injected?\r\n\r\nValidation contexts could be interesting. If, on the other hand, we're not talking about contexts so much as just looking for a nice way to extract and share validations, why not use an `ActiveSupport::Concern`? With the example in the PR:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Autoload model concerns\r\nmodule YourApp\r\n  class Application < Rails::Application\r\n    config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/app/models/concerns)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# app/models/concerns/price_concerns.rb\r\nmodule PriceConcerns\r\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\r\n  \r\n  included do\r\n    validates_presence_of :price\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# app/models/offer.rb\r\nclass Offer < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  include PriceConcerns\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n<3 concerns.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238101dbd3543c15100d60a"}, "issue_id": 6014, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5391933", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6014#issuecomment-5391933", "updated_at": "2012-04-27T22:47:16Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aupajo/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aupajo/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aupajo/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aupajo/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aupajo", "login": "Aupajo", "gravatar_id": "ca3dc3f93730afb41d6753d8bf010a38", "html_url": "https://github.com/Aupajo", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aupajo/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aupajo/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aupajo/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ca3dc3f93730afb41d6753d8bf010a38?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb09007d46d54f6bb4166f7d582a3f5d9.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aupajo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 14123, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Aupajo/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-27T22:45:24Z", "id": 5391933, "owner": "rails"}
