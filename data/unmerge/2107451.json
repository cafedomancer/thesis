As one who deploys multiple times throughout the day, the ability to deploy and update throughout the day without users ever really knowing about it, and without having to have load balancer scripts to rotate machines in and out during deployment, is worth a lot.  I'd trade a lot of disk space for duplicate files to keep this feature.  I guess my thought is this works great now, and breaking this for the sake of elegance might not be worth it.\r\n\r\nRe copying files being wasteful - well, you're right.  However, if I think about the resources I have to trade off, disk space is one of the cheapest.\r\n\r\nYou know, I had another idea:\r\n\r\n4. Perhaps each directory in the assets trees could have an optional manifest sort of file, which could list the requirements for the assets in that directory. By default, everything would work like it does now.  But if one of more of these manifest files exist, they are processed as well.  They could say things like\r\n\r\n\"this directory's logo.png file should be copied to public/assets without a digest\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\"everything in this directory should be copied to public/assets without a digest\"\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52383e0abd3543c151010541"}, "issue_id": 2886, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2107451", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2886#issuecomment-2107451", "updated_at": "2011-09-15T18:29:02Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker", "login": "greinacker", "gravatar_id": "1f4455584c55f3c9cfd2d485439603e5", "html_url": "https://github.com/greinacker", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/1f4455584c55f3c9cfd2d485439603e5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fdd6cd99f4184e944b6afef445f496c04.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 759955, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-09-15T18:29:02Z", "id": 2107451, "owner": "rails"}
