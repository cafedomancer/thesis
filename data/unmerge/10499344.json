That will result in the same as you did, because `Rails.root` was returning `nil` either way (since the application was not loaded, root was not set, but no error was raised). So it worked because of `File.expand_path`.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if the fix works for you, thanks again.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f4c0bd3543c15100aaa2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8257#issuecomment-10499344"}
