{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8257", "repo": "rails", "body": "@ueda82 thanks for reporting, I've checked it and it really doesn't work with sqlite3 due to the way the config is loaded.  \r\n\r\nI have fixed it with a slightly different approach, by checking whether Rails responds to a `root` method instead of just using it. That will result in the same as you did, because `Rails.root` was returning `nil` either way (since the application was not loaded, root was not set, but no error was raised). So it worked because of `File.expand_path`.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if the fix works for you, thanks again.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f4c0bd3543c15100aaa2"}, "issue_id": 8257, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10499344", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8257#issuecomment-10499344", "updated_at": "2012-11-19T02:04:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-19T02:04:32Z", "id": 10499344, "owner": "rails"}
