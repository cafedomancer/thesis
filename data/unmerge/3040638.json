Asking for\r\nthe attribute value should behave the same as if you called the reader\r\nfrom an instantiated object.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, much of the deserialization complexity could be later\r\nfactored out if the intent is to set each Column's @coder at some\r\npoint. The code that exists thus far certainly seems to imply this was\r\nthe direction we were heading in (see Column#type_cast).\r\n\r\nIn short, AR#pluck isn't sufficiently like Enumerable#pluck to share\r\nits name, in any case.\r\n\r\nOn Dec 6, 2011, at 5:18 PM, Jon Leighton\r\n<reply@reply.github.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Thanks for the patch.\r\n>\r\n> To be honest I am not massively keen on this myself though. I like `pluck` because it's pretty damn simple. I think other complexities to deal with serialisation etc are not sufficiently common that they should be handled in Rails core. Plus, I am loathe to add another place where we have to deal with attribute stuff.\r\n>\r\n> I'd be up for having `pluck` take multiple arguments, though.
