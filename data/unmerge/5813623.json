We are trying to improve the Action View now.\n\nAbout the NumberHelpers, #6315 is going to move some helpers to Active Support, so we can decouple Active Support from Action View, as requested in #5675.\n\nI agree with you that some helpers should be requireable on its own, so if you can, please add tests to ensure this behavior to the NumberHelpers. I'll be glad to discuss with the core team to get this pull request merged.", "_id": {"$oid": "523808b5bd3543c15100cc5b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6414#issuecomment-5813623"}
