While it could be useful to interact with the email before it is generated, an interceptor would not be the desired place to do this, there is a `before_action` that already exists to do this.\r\n\r\nWhat are you trying to do exactly? You could modify the locale using a `before_action` in the mailer itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  #   class Notifier < ActionMailer::Base\r\n  #     before_action :add_inline_attachment!\r\n  #\r\n  #     def welcome\r\n  #       mail\r\n  #     end\r\n  #\r\n  #     private\r\n  #\r\n  #       def add_inline_attachment!\r\n  #         attachments.inline[\"footer.jpg\"] = File.read('/path/to/filename.jpg')\r\n  #       end\r\n  #   end\r\n```\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e8a8bd3543c15100971e"}, "issue_id": 9514, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14344803", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9514#issuecomment-14344803", "updated_at": "2013-03-03T10:26:45Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems", "login": "schneems", "gravatar_id": "db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e", "html_url": "https://github.com/schneems", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ef42a6eab211ddd71ac423a80b42d15.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 59744, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-03T10:26:45Z", "id": 14344803, "owner": "rails"}
