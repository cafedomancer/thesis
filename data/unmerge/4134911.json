This currently works out-of-the-box - if we merge this request then you'd have to add the `unless Rails.env.development?` in every controller you use `force_ssl` (ignore for the moment that it's at class level and won't work if you're trying to restrict to an action). \r\n\r\nIf we take your suggestion of an array for `config.force_ssl` then it doesn't help as we don't want `Rack::SSL` configured in any environment so we need to specify an empty array. The `force_ssl` controller method can't use `config.force_ssl` to see if it should run as it's not what we want.\r\n\r\nIf you're suggesting adding `:env => []` to the `force_ssl` then there's no point as you'd still need to specify it everywhere and you can do it already using `:if` in a much cleaner way, e.g:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nclass AccountsController < ApplicationController\r\n  force_ssl :if => :ssl_configured?\r\n  \r\n  def ssl_configured?\r\n    !Rails.env.development?\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy concern is that the common case should work out of the box - maybe add a default implementation of the above that can be overridden.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381dbebd3543c15100e61e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5023#issuecomment-4134911"}
