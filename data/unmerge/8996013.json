{"body": "> This causes a regression if you don't have strict set, though.\r\n\r\nYes. If they explicitly set `strict: false` in their database.yml, then it will be a regression.  However, by setting this config they likely expect quirky behaviour like this.  Do we really want to support this hack to work around this quirk when that is the point strict mode?  If we want to remove it, then the best time to do it is before a major release (e.g. 4.0).\r\n\r\nHere is a commit that would fix the regression if we decide to continue supporting this hack for non-strict mode https://github.com/dylanahsmith/rails/commit/fd1c0afdc9327fbb5d3b47ceb492215dbd4beb9e", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8996013", "created_at": "2012-09-28T21:38:07Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7780#issuecomment-8996013", "updated_at": "2012-09-28T21:38:07Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7780, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/dylanahsmith", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/d6af3d9442783aa00ef1e5d7772f997d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F95f1d47eb81295ff9866b9f7291894c1.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/received_events", "gravatar_id": "d6af3d9442783aa00ef1e5d7772f997d", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "dylanahsmith", "type": "User", "id": 954402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dylanahsmith/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f901bd3543c15100b39d"}, "id": 8996013, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7780"}
