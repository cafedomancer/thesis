Changing respond_to? is not the correct way because even after crystalized, the object responds to *all* methods. We should probably change the test to check with something like:\r\n\r\n    config.public_methods.map(&:to_s).include?(\"foo\")\r\n\r\nObviously, we should encapsulate this check in a method and re-use it accordingly inside the test case. :)", "_id": {"$oid": "52384c5cbd3543c151011429"}, "issue_id": 1903, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1468407", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1903#issuecomment-1468407", "updated_at": "2011-06-29T16:36:48Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-29T16:36:48Z", "id": 1468407, "owner": "rails"}
