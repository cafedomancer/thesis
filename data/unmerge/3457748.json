{"body": "Are you sure this affects find_or_create?\r\n\r\nIf so, any idea why this bug is not showing up in the existing activerecord test suite?  I wouldn't expect that there would necessarily test for the number of queries run or objects initialized, but there are has_many tests that check that find_or_create only creates once, for example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  def test_dynamic_find_or_create_from_two_attributes_using_an_association\r\n    author = authors(:david)\r\n    number_of_posts = Post.count\r\n    another = author.posts.find_or_create_by_title_and_body(\"Another Post\", \"This is the Body\")\r\n    assert_equal number_of_posts + 1, Post.count\r\n    assert_equal another, author.posts.find_or_create_by_title_and_body(\"Another Post\", \"This is the Body\")\r\n    assert another.persisted?\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is passing on the 3-1-stable branch.  For what it's worth, there is also a check on #size after using find_or_initialize, though it could well be doing the find twice:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  def test_find_or_initialize_updates_collection_size\r\n    number_of_clients = companies(:first_firm).clients_of_firm.size\r\n    companies(:first_firm).clients_of_firm.find_or_initialize_by_name(\"name\" => \"Another Client\")\r\n    assert_equal number_of_clients + 1, companies(:first_firm).clients_of_firm.size\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you could create a failing test case for the problem I think that would help get this patch merged a lot.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3457748", "created_at": "2012-01-12T03:14:20Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3610#issuecomment-3457748", "updated_at": "2012-01-12T03:14:20Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3610, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/willbryant/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/willbryant/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/willbryant/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/willbryant", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/willbryant/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/willbryant", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/willbryant/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f1c9a2d6b6be7599854a75793ecd872d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60be21f3ebf28ff7b8a692a752d92cf8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/willbryant/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/willbryant/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f1c9a2d6b6be7599854a75793ecd872d", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/willbryant/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "willbryant", "type": "User", "id": 12062, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/willbryant/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383454bd3543c15100fb3e"}, "id": 3457748, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3610"}
