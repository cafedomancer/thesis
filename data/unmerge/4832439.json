But of course both of those methods usually require an existing record. I see what you're getting at and I think the PATCH vs PUT argument is only relevant when arguing about HTTP caching so I'll digress.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your input", "_id": {"$oid": "523814b1bd3543c15100dc06"}, "issue_id": 5648, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4832439", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5648#issuecomment-4832439", "updated_at": "2012-03-29T22:14:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton", "login": "clifton", "gravatar_id": "4cede21ea96795d2de831e9981cc81cd", "html_url": "https://github.com/clifton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/4cede21ea96795d2de831e9981cc81cd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc27181a18d3b30d14d66a1a56c068548.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 14217, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-29T22:10:37Z", "id": 4832439, "owner": "rails"}
