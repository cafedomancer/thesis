{"body": "The simplest way I can think of, without adding any more configuration possibilities to Rails, would be to have your own `BaseMailer`:\n\n```ruby\nclass BaseMailer < ActionMailer::Base\n  default from: \"noreply@mysite.com\"\nend\n\nclass UserMailer < BaseMailer\n  # from is set\nend\n```\n\nI think this is quite simple code to have in an application and there wouldn't be a need for extra methods/configuration. Well, just my 2 cents :)\n\nThanks for your contribution.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6362554", "created_at": "2012-06-15T17:52:42Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6747#issuecomment-6362554", "updated_at": "2012-06-15T17:52:42Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6747, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "type": "User", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238049bbd3543c15100c5f3"}, "id": 6362554, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6747"}
