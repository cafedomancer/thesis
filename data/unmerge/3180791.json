With how I've implemented PUT, the client assumes no knowledge of what state the resource is in on the server.  It simply doesn't matter.  It always PUTs the entire resource.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the server doesn't need to know if the request body is intended to be a partial or full representation; it uniformly treats it as a complete resource.\r\n\r\nIt makes for simpler, more maintainable code all around.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012137"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3180791"}
