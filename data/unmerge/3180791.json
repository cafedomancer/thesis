{"body": "> @myronmarston then, why do you think partial updates would not allow you to use PUT for creation and update?\r\n\r\nIt's possible, but it adds lots of complexity.  With how I've implemented PUT, the client assumes no knowledge of what state the resource is in on the server.  It simply doesn't matter.
