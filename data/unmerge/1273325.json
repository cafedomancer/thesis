{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1440", "repo": "rails", "body": "I think the ability to encrypt any field and not just password field would be interesting. Something like:\n\n<pre>\nhas_secure_field :some_random_attribute\n</pre>\n\nHowever, it would need more work as at the moment the whole idea of secure field is tightly bound to password but IMHO the code should be able to adapt to any field irrespective. Therefore, I would create a diff pull request for it if it's deemed useful.\n\nOpinion?", "_id": {"$oid": "5238551ebd3543c1510119e8"}, "issue_id": 1440, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1273325", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1440#issuecomment-1273325", "updated_at": "2011-06-01T10:00:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andhapp/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andhapp/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andhapp/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andhapp/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andhapp", "login": "andhapp", "gravatar_id": "7e7bb3bc9e522f86e090f1732adacada", "html_url": "https://github.com/andhapp", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andhapp/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andhapp/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andhapp/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7e7bb3bc9e522f86e090f1732adacada?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0ef41260a5b096182ee7e45b942cd46d.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andhapp/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6663, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andhapp/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-01T09:54:23Z", "id": 1273325, "owner": "rails"}
