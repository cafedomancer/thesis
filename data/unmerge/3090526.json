However according to its [description](http://ss64.com/nt/where.html), it works more like `find -name` ran under `.` and `PATH`.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I suggest that we implement our own platform agnostic `which`. Much like one implemented by Aaron Patterson for [bundler](https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/pull/1573/files). The reason he implemented it was performance though.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383106bd3543c15100f6dc"}, "issue_id": 3840, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3090526", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3840#issuecomment-3090526", "updated_at": "2011-12-10T12:09:09Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem", "login": "waseem", "gravatar_id": "20b986aecf495c7a1d9b1910bd5f2cd2", "html_url": "https://github.com/waseem", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/20b986aecf495c7a1d9b1910bd5f2cd2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7a99ddd64872e5a6b4084867dd14ef4a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 42636, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-10T12:08:22Z", "id": 3090526, "owner": "rails"}
