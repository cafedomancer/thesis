I'd rather change @tenderlove's API to match that.\r\n\r\nAgain: if I want to change the column name I shouldn't have to specify a `nil` authenticator, or worse, type in the default value again, i.e.: \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nhas_secure :password, ActiveModel::Authenticators::BCrypt.new, :column => 'password_hash'\r\n```\r\n\r\nversus\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nhas_secure :password, :column => 'password_hash'\r\n```\r\n\r\nPositional arguments should only be used for the most essential parameters, ones that are likely to be changed. Developers will in all likelihood seldomly need to change the authenticator. That's my opinion, at least.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385c96bd3543c151011f2d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1159#issuecomment-1234587"}
