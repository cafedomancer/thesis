Chaning those is actually an API change... back to work :-)\r\n\r\n@yfeldblum : I like the idea of adding an :iec option to achive what I am interested in. I will work along the lines of that, but since that will extend functionality rather than change I would like make that as a clean commit to master (not as commit on top of this one), so what is the way to do it (github wise). Should a create a new branch (and a new pull request) with a clean commit. Or should I use `git push -f` to overwrite the branch that this Pull Request is associated with?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f883bd3543c15100b2d2"}, "issue_id": 7829, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9117847", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7829#issuecomment-9117847", "updated_at": "2012-10-03T18:56:06Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk", "login": "jarl-dk", "gravatar_id": "968fba3ba6e5df2df68a458218be7104", "html_url": "https://github.com/jarl-dk", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/968fba3ba6e5df2df68a458218be7104?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd0cac2a26433f3f23b23854cd7d9215e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 191521, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-03T18:56:06Z", "id": 9117847, "owner": "rails"}
