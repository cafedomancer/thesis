{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/505", "repo": "rails", "body": "@NZKoz There are good reasons for this. I've cross-posted about this to [rest-discuss](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/18011), and as Jan Algermissen mentions,\r\n\r\n> When a client (or intermediary, for that matter) re-does a PUT N-times (e.g.\r\n> because it did not receive any response the first N-1 times due to network\r\n> problems) the result on the server might not be what the client assumes it is,\r\n> given the idempotent nature of PUT.\r\n> \r\n> A client that is aware of the server's tunneling-partial-update-through-PUT\r\n> semantics might not redo the PUT but any intermediary in between might (because\r\n> they would not be aware of the out-of-band knowledge / just like Google\r\n> accelerator in the case of GET-to-delete-account).\r\n> \r\n> What is the problem of just using POST for the partial update in the first\r\n> place? This is what POST is for.\r\n\r\nAlso, 'bible-thumping' is just a way to dismiss arguments; you either follow web standards or you don't. Rails has brought REST(ish) to many, many people, and the choices Rails makes are important. When IE6 didn't follow the standard initially, it was an excellent browser. Years later, we can see how that was a mistake.\r\n\r\nI don't even mean this as 'let's implement PATCH,' as that's not yet a true standard. But `update` should really use POST by default, since most people aren't actually PUT-ing full representations.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012129"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3161966", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3161966", "updated_at": "2011-12-15T14:58:46Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "login": "steveklabnik", "gravatar_id": "233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0c22d45f31acf0f4192c8c12b7a55dee.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 27786, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-15T14:58:46Z", "id": 3161966, "owner": "rails"}
