But that requires AS changing the core Time class, or TWZ doing the annoying thing of returning getlocal. I really think that Ruby core should fix it and back port, unless they had a valid reasoning.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238435ebd3543c151010c1f"}, "issue_id": 2453, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6050267", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2453#issuecomment-6050267", "updated_at": "2012-05-31T23:31:16Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adzap/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adzap/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adzap/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adzap/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/adzap", "login": "adzap", "gravatar_id": "21126416f8a3de608f82069ab943a336", "html_url": "https://github.com/adzap", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adzap/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adzap/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adzap/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/21126416f8a3de608f82069ab943a336?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb0eb9a95e8b085e4025eae2f0d76a6a6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adzap/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6318, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adzap/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-31T23:31:16Z", "id": 6050267, "owner": "rails"}
