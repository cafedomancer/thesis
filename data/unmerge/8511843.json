You are explicitly telling rails that those values are HTML safe, that's the fundamental thing that's wrong. We could fix it here, but we couldn't fix <%= fake_safe %>, or any other related areas.  If you don't know that a string is safe, don't tell rails that that string is safe.\n\nIt's not a good idea to create a special-case in this one area which complicates the html escaping code.\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523ddb11bd354364b900abc7"}, "issue_id": 7611, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8511843", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7611#issuecomment-8511843", "updated_at": "2012-09-12T22:06:35Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-12T22:06:35Z", "id": 8511843, "owner": "rails"}
