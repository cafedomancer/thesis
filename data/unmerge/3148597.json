All it has to say is *The PATCH, LINK, UNLINK methods were defined but not commonly implemented in previous versions of this specification. See RFC 2068 [33].* To me this doesn't say that PATCH is a part of HTTP 1.1. Also the [proposed standard for PATCH](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) (not a draft standard) doesn't include any of the authors of RFC2616 in its list of authors, and I couldn't find any support for RFC5789 from Fielding online.\r\n> \r\n> So PATCH feels pretty random to me. Much more random than semantically replacing a document with an updated version but leaving created_at, updated_at, and id intact, and maybe omitting some unchanged fields for efficiency.\r\n> \r\n> --- \r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3148453", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c15101211e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3148597"}
