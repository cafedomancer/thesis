All it has to say is *The PATCH, LINK, UNLINK methods were defined but not commonly implemented in previous versions of this specification. See RFC 2068 [33].* To me this doesn't say that PATCH is a part of HTTP 1.1. Also the [proposed standard for PATCH](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) (not a draft standard) doesn't include any of the authors of RFC2616 in its list of authors, and I couldn't find any support for RFC5789 from Fielding online.\r\n> \r\n> So PATCH feels pretty random to me. Much more random than semantically replacing a document with an updated version but leaving created_at, updated_at, and id intact, and maybe omitting some unchanged fields for efficiency.\r\n> \r\n> --- \r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3148453", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c15101211e"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3148597", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3148597", "updated_at": "2011-12-14T20:35:36Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkh/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkh/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkh/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkh/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkh", "login": "rkh", "gravatar_id": "5c2b452f6eea4a6d84c105ebd971d2a4", "html_url": "https://github.com/rkh", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkh/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkh/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkh/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5c2b452f6eea4a6d84c105ebd971d2a4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2ae3d2aaceaf26246581744124859b07.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 30442, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rkh/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-14T20:35:36Z", "id": 3148597, "owner": "rails"}
