I'm having problems trying to update this pull request, so will close it and redo it yet again. New request is https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11323  I think I'm having problems because I'm forking to my own repo, then pulling and pushing to it before creating requests back to rails/rails.  Do you have any advice on the best way to do this, to enable updates of pull requests? Thanks for the pointer to your tutorial on squashing commits; the tutorial I first used was incorrect which is what messed up my earlier attempts to squash the commits.\r\n\r\nAlso, the manifest-md5hash.json file example didn't truncate to 80 columns in vim, so it is displaying as one long line. I'm using the ```json markup for it.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d658bd3543c1510082b6"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11308#issuecomment-20547961"}
