I think there's a good case to make that it wasn't ever desirable since a) there was no other way to allow_nil on that validator and b) it was not documented in the rdocs.  It seems unlikely to destabilize an app since these options were simply ignored before, hence very unlikely to be used.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the fact that this change restores orthogonal behavior by *removing* a special case that no longer needs to be documented in the Rails Guide is proof that it's valuable! :)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f18fbd3543c15100a475"}, "issue_id": 8622, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11696527", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8622#issuecomment-11696527", "updated_at": "2012-12-26T23:13:26Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley", "login": "ColinDKelley", "gravatar_id": "0a38a3f16001fa9c426c90ffd94e03d0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ColinDKelley", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/0a38a3f16001fa9c426c90ffd94e03d0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fccbc7407a51bbac276e820ad5d73552b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 166511, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-26T23:13:26Z", "id": 11696527, "owner": "rails"}
