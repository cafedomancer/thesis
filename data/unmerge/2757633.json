{"body": "@NZKoz I don't think the \"route proliferation\" is so bad. In fact, even if Rails ends up supporting PATCH in the distant future, I'd prefer PUT be left as a standard route, perhaps linked to a different action (replace/upsert/etc.) This might not jive with a must-map-to-CRUD mindset, but it definitely jives with HTTP.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of the RFC is not neurotic; I think we all share a clear and straightforward interpretation. I'll assume you meant \"neurotic *adherence* to the RFC\".\r\n\r\nIf so, let me reiterate that supporting PATCH is not to *merely* adhere to an RFC. The reason is because Rails currently has broken support for HTTP as commonly understood--leading to potentially problematic interoperability with RESTful clients, caching mechanisms, and proxies.\r\n\r\nI'd say implementing, documenting, and promoting a broken implementation of an HTTP VERB is a genuine bug, warranting a fix in a minor release, but I'll leave the decision up to the Rails core team.\r\n\r\nFinally, Rails shouldn't inhibit change just to retain backwards compatibility with blogs, books, and screencasts.
