{"body": "There's also the potential confusion. Both SomeClass#as_json and SomeClass#to_json are supposed to raise CircularReferenceError currently (with a lot of edge cases, again see #11460). Since SomeClass#to_json goes through the encoder and SomeClass#as_json does not (anymore), if we leave the protection on the encoder then CircularReferenceError will continue to work on SomeClass#to_json but not SomeClass#as_json. That's \"correct\", but perhaps a confusing change in behaviour, so given the very little benefit (there aren't much to \"protect\" here) I'm not sure if it's worth the trouble.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/23073202", "created_at": "2013-08-22T07:47:07Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11975#issuecomment-23073202", "updated_at": "2013-08-22T07:47:07Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 11975, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/chancancode", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b407b57d02a2e41c7ba54441391d9ce.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/received_events", "gravatar_id": "22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "chancancode", "type": "User", "id": 55829, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cf9dbd3543c151007b91"}, "id": 23073202, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11975"}
