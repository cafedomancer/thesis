Both SomeClass#as_json and SomeClass#to_json are supposed to raise CircularReferenceError currently (with a lot of edge cases, again see #11460). Since SomeClass#to_json goes through the encoder and SomeClass#as_json does not (anymore), if we leave the protection on the encoder then CircularReferenceError will continue to work on SomeClass#to_json but not SomeClass#as_json. That's \"correct\", but perhaps a confusing change in behaviour, so given the very little benefit (there aren't much to \"protect\" here) I'm not sure if it's worth the trouble.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cf9dbd3543c151007b91"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11975#issuecomment-23073202"}
