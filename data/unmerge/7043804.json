{"body": "I am :-1: on this as I don't think we should generate that much code into a user application. I can't honestly remember the last time I ran into an inflection exception and that is easy enough to fix, it doesn't justify all that noise in new apps.\n\nA possible more elegant solution to the problem is to version inflections and we could keep it in the framework as times passes. The application would simply choose a version. Hopefully, changes will be rare and we won't introduce many new versions since the goal is **not** to have a complete set of inflections with all special cases.\n\nLet's discuss more about the subject as we go.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7043804", "created_at": "2012-07-17T18:05:35Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7071#issuecomment-7043804", "updated_at": "2012-07-17T18:05:35Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7071, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380016bd3543c15100bf2f"}, "id": 7043804, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7071"}
