{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/4405", "repo": "rails", "body": "The thing is, right now on Linux, when you run `rails new`, you do not actually get a runnable app. Run `rails new`, try to start your app, you get an error message directing you to a web page.\r\n\r\nUntil the asset pipeline, it was always true that `rails new` would give you a runnable app (thanks to sqlite3). Which is a great thing, immediate satisfaction, especially to newbies. \r\n\r\nI think currently, this is a fairly frustrating thing for newbies, their first experience with rails is an error message, leading them to a web page that can be somewhat confusing for the newbie. \r\n\r\nAdded complexity?  I think improving the experience to what it used to be -- `rails new` gives you a runnable app -- is probably worth 35 lines of code. \r\n\r\nI wonder how many of the people who are against this routinely develop on linux, where it's an issue.
