Which is a great thing, immediate satisfaction, especially to newbies. \r\n\r\nI think currently, this is a fairly frustrating thing for newbies, their first experience with rails is an error message, leading them to a web page that can be somewhat confusing for the newbie. \r\n\r\nAdded complexity?  I think improving the experience to what it used to be -- `rails new` gives you a runnable app -- is probably worth 35 lines of code. \r\n\r\nI wonder how many of the people who are against this routinely develop on linux, where it's an issue.
