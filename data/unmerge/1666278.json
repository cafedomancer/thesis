{"body": "I think this is a tricky thing to fix without breaking backwards compatibility in some way. As is, this patch breaks it for anything that includes `ActiveModel::Serialization` but not `ActiveModel::Serialization::JSON` -- as indicated by the the change you had to make in serialization_test.rb.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm not sure why anyone would be doing that, as `ActiveModel::Serialization` is not that useful on its own. And because `ActiveModel::Serialization::XML` doesn't even end up using `serializable_hash`, I'm not sure what purpose `serializable_hash` serves that wouldn't be served by `as_json` directly doing what `serializable_hash` does. In other words, it looks like an abstraction that needlessly increases the API surface area without providing much of a benefit. So maybe we should break BC -- and remove `serializable_hash` entirely (or alias it to `as_json` and deprecate it).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1666278", "created_at": "2011-07-27T18:29:15Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2200#issuecomment-1666278", "updated_at": "2011-07-27T18:30:52Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 2200, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jfirebaugh", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/a82409021ddf415a8027872b889c5f74?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9db597035f77a6c1167e05ca916801fa.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/received_events", "gravatar_id": "a82409021ddf415a8027872b889c5f74", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jfirebaugh", "type": "User", "id": 98601, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238472ebd3543c15101103a"}, "id": 1666278, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2200"}
