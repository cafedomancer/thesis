As is, this patch breaks it for anything that includes `ActiveModel::Serialization` but not `ActiveModel::Serialization::JSON` -- as indicated by the the change you had to make in serialization_test.rb.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm not sure why anyone would be doing that, as `ActiveModel::Serialization` is not that useful on its own. And because `ActiveModel::Serialization::XML` doesn't even end up using `serializable_hash`, I'm not sure what purpose `serializable_hash` serves that wouldn't be served by `as_json` directly doing what `serializable_hash` does. In other words, it looks like an abstraction that needlessly increases the API surface area without providing much of a benefit. So maybe we should break BC -- and remove `serializable_hash` entirely (or alias it to `as_json` and deprecate it).", "_id": {"$oid": "5238472ebd3543c15101103a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2200#issuecomment-1666278"}
