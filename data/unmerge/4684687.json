When we want to refer to the actual constants, we write `true` and `false`.\r\n\r\nThe fact that `nil` is considered to be false is convenient. For example, `IO#gets`, which returns the next line from a file, returns `nil` at the end of file, enabling you to write loops such as this:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nwhile line = gets\r\n  # process line\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, C, C++, and Perl programmers sometimes fall into a trap. The number zero is _not_ interpreted as a false value. Neither is a zero-length string. This can be a tough habit to break.\"\r\n\r\nI wrote the API documentation guidelines some four years ago, and that has been our convention ever since.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523815d4bd3543c15100dd9d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5572#issuecomment-4684687"}
