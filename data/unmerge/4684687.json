When we want to refer to the actual constants, we write `true` and `false`.\r\n\r\nThe fact that `nil` is considered to be false is convenient. For example, `IO#gets`, which returns the next line from a file, returns `nil` at the end of file, enabling you to write loops such as this:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nwhile line = gets\r\n  # process line\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, C, C++, and Perl programmers sometimes fall into a trap. The number zero is _not_ interpreted as a false value. Neither is a zero-length string. This can be a tough habit to break.\"\r\n\r\nI wrote the API documentation guidelines some four years ago, and that has been our convention ever since.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523815d4bd3543c15100dd9d"}, "issue_id": 5572, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4684687", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5572#issuecomment-4684687", "updated_at": "2012-03-25T21:10:00Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-25T21:07:58Z", "id": 4684687, "owner": "rails"}
