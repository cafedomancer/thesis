Technically we'd need a test to ensure we won't break what you're trying to fix here in future releases of Rails, so I have to ask you to write at least one test case to ensure that.\n\nAlso, please send a new pull request to master first (linking to this one), if it gets applied we'll check if a backport to 3-2 is needed or not.
