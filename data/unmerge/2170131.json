{"body": "I struggled with the class name when I was writing it.  I also considered `is_a_defined_class?` and `is_a_defined_class_name?`, but felt the former was not accurate and the latter perhaps too verbose.\r\n\r\nThat said I like your `safe_constantize` idea.  `my_string.safe_constantize.is_a?(Class)` isn't much longer than `my_string.is_a_class_name?` and is certainly more flexible.  One thing that comes to mind is that using the names `constantize` and `constantize!` might be a bit tidier (and perhaps more informative) than `safe_constantize` and `constantize`.  Of course, there's a ton of code that depends on the existing implementation of `constantize` so there would need to be some sort of strategy to deal with that.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2170131", "created_at": "2011-09-22T17:44:25Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3098#issuecomment-2170131", "updated_at": "2011-09-22T17:44:25Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3098, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/rroblak", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/16f606d6f3cd4f7b742ec0d6db1674bf?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4df49b56bc16bcda30bb2dac13bce603.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/received_events", "gravatar_id": "16f606d6f3cd4f7b742ec0d6db1674bf", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "rroblak", "type": "User", "id": 103835, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383ac6bd3543c151010203"}, "id": 2170131, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3098"}
