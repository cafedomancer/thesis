{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3098", "repo": "rails", "body": "I struggled with the class name when I was writing it.  I also considered `is_a_defined_class?` and `is_a_defined_class_name?`, but felt the former was not accurate and the latter perhaps too verbose.\r\n\r\nThat said I like your `safe_constantize` idea.  `my_string.safe_constantize.is_a?(Class)` isn't much longer than `my_string.is_a_class_name?` and is certainly more flexible.  One thing that comes to mind is that using the names `constantize` and `constantize!` might be a bit tidier (and perhaps more informative) than `safe_constantize` and `constantize`.  Of course, there's a ton of code that depends on the existing implementation of `constantize` so there would need to be some sort of strategy to deal with that.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383ac6bd3543c151010203"}, "issue_id": 3098, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2170131", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3098#issuecomment-2170131", "updated_at": "2011-09-22T17:44:25Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak", "login": "rroblak", "gravatar_id": "16f606d6f3cd4f7b742ec0d6db1674bf", "html_url": "https://github.com/rroblak", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/16f606d6f3cd4f7b742ec0d6db1674bf?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4df49b56bc16bcda30bb2dac13bce603.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 103835, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-09-22T17:44:25Z", "id": 2170131, "owner": "rails"}
