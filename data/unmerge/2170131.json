I also considered `is_a_defined_class?` and `is_a_defined_class_name?`, but felt the former was not accurate and the latter perhaps too verbose.\r\n\r\nThat said I like your `safe_constantize` idea.  `my_string.safe_constantize.is_a?(Class)` isn't much longer than `my_string.is_a_class_name?` and is certainly more flexible.  One thing that comes to mind is that using the names `constantize` and `constantize!` might be a bit tidier (and perhaps more informative) than `safe_constantize` and `constantize`.  Of course, there's a ton of code that depends on the existing implementation of `constantize` so there would need to be some sort of strategy to deal with that.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383ac6bd3543c151010203"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3098#issuecomment-2170131"}
