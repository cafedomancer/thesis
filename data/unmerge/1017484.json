{"body": "@dhh, Our mobile apps were using authentication (not necessarily client login) to authorize requests against a webservice API.  I dont still have our original test results lying around to give you, but each time you lower the work factor for BCrypt, the speed increases substantially.\r\n\r\nWe settled on a work factor of 8.  Provides strong enough encryption and a long enough brute-force cracking time that we were comfortable for our use case, but again, that will vary per project and user taste.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I dont have my original benchmarks, but my results follow what brian posted earlier.\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding just using token based auth for API's, that is all fine and good but doesnt always fly.  We, in fact, were using token auth, but due to the program specs, tokens expired after 24 hours which required re-auth to generate a new token.  This is actually quite common, to have token expiry.  (Think government contract apps with arcane, and sometimes pointless specs, that still need to be followed).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1017484", "created_at": "2011-04-17T18:20:53Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/285#issuecomment-1017484", "updated_at": "2011-04-17T18:20:53Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 285, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/cpjolicoeur", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/cf8a610127d1108dfe67f673320b5fe5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F19b650660b253761af189682e03501dd.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/received_events", "gravatar_id": "cf8a610127d1108dfe67f673320b5fe5", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "cpjolicoeur", "type": "User", "id": 863, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238635abd3543c1510124bc"}, "id": 1017484, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/285"}
