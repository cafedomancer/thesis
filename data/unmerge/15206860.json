{"body": "I think I'd rather not have this option in Rails 3, so that people can consciously choose whether they're really needing a get/post VS allowing to match all. By adding this option, we'd opening the ports for everyone to change match to match all to solve the problem, and the overall idea of not allowing match with a specific verb/verbs would be kinda useless I think. Just my cents about the change, lets get other feedback before acting.
