{"body": "@mauricio thanks!\n\nI just noticed your pull request targets 3-2 stable. We usually merge in master first, and then backport as needed, so could you please send another pull request targeting master instead (github does not allow to change the target branch)? I'll check with others if it's ok to backport it or not. While doing that, I'll ask you to squash the commits as well.
