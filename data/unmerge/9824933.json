Unless the `change` method was called in a `migrate:down`, in which case everything **not** inside the block of the `revert` will be reverted and things in the `revert` block will be executed as is.\r\n\r\nI'm probably not being entirely clear, because I'm not sure what the confusion is. If it's clear that `def change; create_table :foo; end` can actually drop a table (when called from `migrate:down`), then it should be clear that `def change; revert { create_table :foo }; end` can actually drop a table (when not called from `migrate:down`).\r\n\r\n  ", "_id": {"$oid": "523dda17bd354364b900aaeb"}, "issue_id": 7627, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9824933", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7627#issuecomment-9824933", "updated_at": "2012-10-26T19:50:54Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre", "login": "marcandre", "gravatar_id": "b06d8e26b92456b228d3c77b66397534", "html_url": "https://github.com/marcandre", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b06d8e26b92456b228d3c77b66397534?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b48ea597d2862688e4aa8a2b28651a3.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 33770, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-26T19:50:54Z", "id": 9824933, "owner": "rails"}
