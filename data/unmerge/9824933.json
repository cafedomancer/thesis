Unless the `change` method was called in a `migrate:down`, in which case everything **not** inside the block of the `revert` will be reverted and things in the `revert` block will be executed as is.\r\n\r\nI'm probably not being entirely clear, because I'm not sure what the confusion is. If it's clear that `def change; create_table :foo; end` can actually drop a table (when called from `migrate:down`), then it should be clear that `def change; revert { create_table :foo }; end` can actually drop a table (when not called from `migrate:down`).\r\n\r\n  ", "_id": {"$oid": "523dda17bd354364b900aaeb"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7627#issuecomment-9824933"}
