What I want to avoid is add more deprecation warnings in this release for cosmetics changes.\r\n\r\nOne option would not add deprecation warnings, like you said, but this would mean add one more option in the API that may confuse the people saying in an application using both options.\r\nThey can think: \"When should I use `:class`, and when should I use `:class_name`?\"\r\nWe did some work to make the API simpler in this release and I think it is a good direction to take.\r\n\r\n@garysweaver it was not waste of time, it is a valid request and we considered it. Maybe is not time yet, in a next release we can revisit it.\r\n\r\nAnd again, thank you so much for trying to make Rails better, we really appreciate it.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f3e9bd3543c15100a930"}, "issue_id": 8357, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10848503", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8357#issuecomment-10848503", "updated_at": "2012-11-29T14:16:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca", "login": "rafaelfranca", "gravatar_id": "0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03", "html_url": "https://github.com/rafaelfranca", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2c7b84fa30f0cea96a90729afe2970a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 47848, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-29T14:16:15Z", "id": 10848503, "owner": "rails"}
