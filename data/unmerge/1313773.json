With namespaced models all sorts of trouble occurs with autoloading/unloading/reloading in dev mode, forcing restarts of rails console or server sessions for each iteration. Might as well have to link and compile between changes!\r\n\r\nSo, please illuminate how to access the existing lighthouse tickets (interestingly #2283 was not imported to github--maybe all of the tickets should be imported even if they were supposedly closed?) and what the current solutions are to fix namespaced model loading/unloading/reloading in dev mode.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523857a2bd3543c151011b82"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1422#issuecomment-1313773"}
