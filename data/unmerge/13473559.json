For example, if you have a model Recipe and you are using ingredients as nested attributes, you can do something like:\r\n\r\n    validates :ingredients, length: 1..10\r\n\r\nSomeone also mentioned an example with hstore.\r\n\r\n>  If i need to validate/typecast them before validator - this is wrong behavior.\r\n\r\nYou are not supposed to typecast because of the validator, you are supposed to typecast simply because it is the correct thing to do. In my opinion, the fact you can do this is wrong:\r\n\r\n    post = Post.new\r\n    post.title = [1,2,3]\r\n    post.title #=> [1,2,3]\r\n\r\nYou should not get an array back. It should be typecast to a string once you set it (or raise an exception).", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ebddbd3543c151009bd0"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9235#issuecomment-13473559"}
