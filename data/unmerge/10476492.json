Wouldn't this paragraph be an argument against @chancancode's 4th point?\r\n\r\n>Rails major versions usually make substantial breaking changes. The primary difference between minor and major releases in Rails is the magnitude of the breaking changes. Changes made in minor versions are small and should not require large-scale application changes, unless required for security fixes. Changes made in major releases often do require large-scale application changes (think XSS protection in Rails 3.0 and the Ruby 1.9 requirement in Rails 4.0).\r\n\r\nJust finding it interesting that, in a topic where many claim Rails doesn't follow Semver, you link directly to @wycats' comment stating that it does actually follow a form of Semver where major upgrades introduce breaking changes of a high order of magnitude (such as breaking changes that would be brought in via fixing the inflector)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ff99bd3543c15100be6b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7134#issuecomment-10476492"}
