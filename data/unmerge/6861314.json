On a second thought I think this approach is not a good idea because since `underscore` respects underscores this change would be backwards incompatible.\n\nThat is, today one can autoload `A_B::C_D`, and have the class defined in _a_b/c_d.rb_.\n\nOn the other hand, the test suite has some test cases for camelized strings with underscores that people may be relying on.\n\nAll in all, this may be an edge case that perhaps does not justify breaking existing code. In some cases `require_dependency` may be a workaround.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380dbabd3543c15100d324"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6105#issuecomment-6861314"}
