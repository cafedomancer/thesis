It adds *a lot* of complexity to the method, mainly not required complexity for most use cases, and also brings with it being a bit slower. Besides that, there are no tests ;)\n\nAnyway, for your use case I believe it's completely possible to use `presence` instead:\n\n```ruby\na = b[\"foo\"][\"bar\"][\"stuff\"].blank? ? b[\"foo\"][\"stuff\"] : b[\"foo\"][\"bar\"][\"stuff\"]\n# should be the same as\na = b[\"foo\"][\"bar\"][\"stuff\"].presence || b[\"foo\"][\"stuff\"]\n```\n\nThanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "52380242bd3543c15100c2b0"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6888#issuecomment-6620561"}
