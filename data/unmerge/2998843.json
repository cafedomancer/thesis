They are likely not going to want to upload all the images on their development machine that they will have uploaded on their production server. So perhaps placing /public/ in .gitignore is a good default? Their stylesheets and javascripts will be version controlled under /app/assets/, so their code will maintain integrity that way.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52383449bd3543c15100fb30"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3615#issuecomment-2998843"}
