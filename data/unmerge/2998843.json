{"body": "Probably a good idea for people to .gitignore /public/ if they are using the asset pipeline, especially if they are doing some kind of content management where images are uploaded. They are likely not going to want to upload all the images on their development machine that they will have uploaded on their production server. So perhaps placing /public/ in .gitignore is a good default? Their stylesheets and javascripts will be version controlled under /app/assets/, so their code will maintain integrity that way.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2998843", "created_at": "2011-12-03T03:28:42Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3615#issuecomment-2998843", "updated_at": "2011-12-03T03:40:13Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3615, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/Alamoz", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/acfe9766803c7317f1143d919755d016?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb9293e1a3e6919cf510a787da16875fd.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/received_events", "gravatar_id": "acfe9766803c7317f1143d919755d016", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "Alamoz", "type": "User", "id": 905505, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383449bd3543c15100fb30"}, "id": 2998843, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3615"}
