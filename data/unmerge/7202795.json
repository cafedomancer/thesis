{"body": "@grosser I have talked to @jeremy and he suggested to deprecate passing a class to `observe`. This will force everyone to use strings so we don't need to worry about supporting many different behaviors (if someone pass a class, just convert it to string and show the deprecation warning).\n\n@grosser could you please also add a method like `AR::Observer.load_all!` (or in Active Model) that will load all observers? I am working on a configuration named `config.eager_load` and that should trigger `AR::Observer.load_all!`. Since this configuration will be true for test and production, we will be able to detect the \"ClassThatDoesNotExist\" case.\n\nFinally, I agree with @dmathieu, if we could make symbols and strings to behave similarly, better.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7202795", "created_at": "2012-07-24T09:48:00Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7064#issuecomment-7202795", "updated_at": "2012-07-24T09:48:00Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7064, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e0b2cbd354364b900cd87"}, "id": 7202795, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7064"}
