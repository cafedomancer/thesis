This will force everyone to use strings so we don't need to worry about supporting many different behaviors (if someone pass a class, just convert it to string and show the deprecation warning).\n\n@grosser could you please also add a method like `AR::Observer.load_all!` (or in Active Model) that will load all observers? I am working on a configuration named `config.eager_load` and that should trigger `AR::Observer.load_all!`. Since this configuration will be true for test and production, we will be able to detect the \"ClassThatDoesNotExist\" case.\n\nFinally, I agree with @dmathieu, if we could make symbols and strings to behave similarly, better.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e0b2cbd354364b900cd87"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7064#issuecomment-7202795"}
