I suspect that if body is a raw socket then it won't have rewind...\r\n\u2014\r\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20621686", "created_at": "2013-07-08T17:25:50Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11357#issuecomment-20621686", "updated_at": "2013-07-08T17:39:59Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 11357, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/Alamoz", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/acfe9766803c7317f1143d919755d016?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb9293e1a3e6919cf510a787da16875fd.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/received_events", "gravatar_id": "acfe9766803c7317f1143d919755d016", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "Alamoz", "type": "User", "id": 905505, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d5c2bd3543c151008226"}, "id": 20621686, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11357"}
