{"body": "Thanks Ben.\r\n\r\nAs already explained, there is no need to change this or any other predicate to return singletons (you know that). And the documentation does not need (and we never do) to leak the implementation. The contract is a true or false value according to Ruby semantics.\r\n\r\nThe methods in the standard library document the return value because at the core level you commit to an implementation/contract that preserves that value *and* you believe the value may be useful to the caller.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n\r\n    if offset = (string =~ regexp)\r\n      # there's a match, and I am going to use offset\r\n    end\r\n\r\nBut in our predicates the exact values do not belong to the contract, we only tell the user that the predicate behaves like a predicate.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4680846", "created_at": "2012-03-25T10:50:01Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5572#issuecomment-4680846", "updated_at": "2012-03-25T11:10:42Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5572, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "fxn", "type": "User", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523815d4bd3543c15100dd95"}, "id": 4680846, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5572"}
