And the documentation does not need (and we never do) to leak the implementation. The contract is a true or false value according to Ruby semantics.\r\n\r\nThe methods in the standard library document the return value because at the core level you commit to an implementation/contract that preserves that value *and* you believe the value may be useful to the caller.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n\r\n    if offset = (string =~ regexp)\r\n      # there's a match, and I am going to use offset\r\n    end\r\n\r\nBut in our predicates the exact values do not belong to the contract, we only tell the user that the predicate behaves like a predicate.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523815d4bd3543c15100dd95"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5572#issuecomment-4680846"}
