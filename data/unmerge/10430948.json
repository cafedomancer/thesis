I am sure that worked in the past.\r\n\r\nWe have two use cases here.\r\n\r\nIn the stable docs, the version is the git tag, eg \"v3.2.9\". The shell script that detects there is a new stable version passes the tag name to the stable docs generator via `RAILS_VERSION`, and it is used both in the title (within parens), and in the link of the preamble.\r\n\r\nIn the edge docs, I believe we could also pass the SHA1 in `RAILS_VERSION` and remove the backticks. To make it uniform. I would update the scripts in the server.\r\n\r\nThen, if `@edge` is true a simple `@version[0, 7]` within parens would suffice for the title.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f50bbd3543c15100ab40"}, "issue_id": 8221, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10430948", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8221#issuecomment-10430948", "updated_at": "2012-11-15T23:45:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-15T23:44:37Z", "id": 10430948, "owner": "rails"}
