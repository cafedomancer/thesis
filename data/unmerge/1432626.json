What we should do is handle the error properly - I'm assuming it's a lock wait timeout error? Also what is your lock timeout value? The default is 50 seconds - I'm guessing you've got yours set to something like 1 or 2 seconds?\r\n\r\nRegarding whether to compare marshalled or unmarshalled data, remember that Object#== will return false for different instances so if you have a object in the session which doesn't override == then unmarshalling the data again will create a new instance and make original_data == data false even if nothing has changed.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384d5fbd3543c1510114d6"}, "issue_id": 1846, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1432626", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1846#issuecomment-1432626", "updated_at": "2011-06-24T14:28:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-24T14:28:32Z", "id": 1432626, "owner": "rails"}
