What we should do is handle the error properly - I'm assuming it's a lock wait timeout error? Also what is your lock timeout value? The default is 50 seconds - I'm guessing you've got yours set to something like 1 or 2 seconds?\r\n\r\nRegarding whether to compare marshalled or unmarshalled data, remember that Object#== will return false for different instances so if you have a object in the session which doesn't override == then unmarshalling the data again will create a new instance and make original_data == data false even if nothing has changed.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384d5fbd3543c1510114d6"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1846#issuecomment-1432626"}
