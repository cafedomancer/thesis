Are you suggesting using `Rails::Engine.config['app']` as the base path or instead iterating through each of the keys and providing dependency helpers for the paths in each value?\r\n\r\n2. I am OK with the `require_dependency` idiom, I'm just wondering if there is a use case to get the absolute path of the different app resources outside of requiring? In that case wouldn't it make sense to just provide the paths and rely upon the user to explicitly `require` instead?", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c95bd3543c15100e4f0"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5120#issuecomment-4088909"}
