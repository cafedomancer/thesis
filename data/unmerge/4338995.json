How can I implement this fix? I tried to use your fork but it conflicts with some dependencies (you need actionpack 4.0.0.beta but simple_form 2.0.0.rc (I use this version because last one is not compatible with client-validation...) requires 3.0.0.\r\n\r\nI know that I could fork rails 3.2.1 and make the fix myself but I thought there would be a better way. Thx! ", "_id": {"$oid": "52381bbdbd3543c15100e432"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5180#issuecomment-4338995"}
