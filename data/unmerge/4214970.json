{"body": "@jeremy I was looking into this and it seems `ActiveSupport::BasicObject` (which `ActiveSupport::Duration` inherits from) is used only for Duration and an active resource spec. Also `BasicObjects` docs says \"Used for proxy classes\". Would be the case of renaming it into ProxyObject and placing `send` and `try` in there?\r\n\r\nOr do you prefer `Duration < ProxyObject < BasicObject`?\r\n\r\nWould be happy to provide a patch.\r\n\r\n/cc @josevalim ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4214970", "created_at": "2012-02-28T12:46:03Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/320#issuecomment-4214970", "updated_at": "2012-02-28T12:46:03Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 320, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/mhfs", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/9c9854582906c67a71b50833d2d059f1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F804506a8b44444c4483864113b922d42.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9c9854582906c67a71b50833d2d059f1", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "mhfs", "type": "User", "id": 78422, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhfs/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238623bbd3543c1510123d5"}, "id": 4214970, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/320"}
