However, we should be secure by default. The combination of params parsing and Active Record API makes it easy to inadvertently open a vulnerability. This is a door that should take serious effort to open, not an accident or oversight. Hang in there.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you can work around this by swapping out the ParamsParser middleware with your own:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.middleware.swap ActionDispatch::ParamsParser,\r\n  ActionDispatch::ParamsParser,\r\n  Mime::JSON => lambda { |body| Yajl.load(body).with_indifferent_access }\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ef20bd3543c15100a0c9"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8870#issuecomment-12131668"}
