{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/285", "repo": "rails", "body": "Those arguments are assuming that we wouldn't just choose a good default to stay current with whatever changes might happen over time. We're already using BCrypt::Engine::DEFAULT_COST, so if this value changes over time, we're automatically good. In addition, you can always redefine that constant if you must and are not willing to overwrite the 4-line #password= method.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if you're so well-versed in these matters that you do your own cost value analysis, stay up to date on it over time, and tweak this on a regular basis, you're not the target audience for this feature. This feature serves two purposes: 1) Tell Rails developers that BCrypt is a best practice, 2) Give them a little bit of sugar to persuade them to use it right now and they'll have AWESOME password security compared to the industry standard.\r\n\r\nThat Authlogic post only seems to reinforce this view of the world.\r\n\r\nThus, the only argument I've heard so far that's persuasive is that a default cost of 10 would not be suitable for a per-request authentication scheme, like an API or http auth. I'll await the presentation of data on that point, but unless that's very compelling, I've not heard other arguments that would change my mind on no setting here.\r\n\r\n(Regardless, I do appreciate the debate. It's healthy. Especially on security matters.)", "_id": {"$oid": "5238635abd3543c1510124b2"}, "issue_id": 285, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1017191", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/285#issuecomment-1017191", "updated_at": "2011-04-17T16:35:56Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh", "login": "dhh", "gravatar_id": "ed9635566b34ade32274f510f0f9a6d2", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhh", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ed9635566b34ade32274f510f0f9a6d2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fcdcb2f5c7b071143529ef7f2705dfbc4.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2741, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-17T16:35:56Z", "id": 1017191, "owner": "rails"}
