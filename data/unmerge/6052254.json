{"body": "Any thoughts on the name of the option? Some of my thoughts:\n:multiline => true\n:multiline_anchors => true\n:line_matching => true\nPersonally I am leaning towards :multiline_anchors, as it says exactly what it does in a clear way (i.e. allow/support/using multiline anchors).\n\nNote that the check will not catch all cases, but it should catch the vast majority of them. For example \"one|^two$|three\" will not be caught by the check. But I think checking for all those different cases is not particularly important, useful or necessary - what we are trying to do is just help the programmer by checking for the most common error, without introducing overly complicated checking logic.\n\nI suggest for the change to be merged into 4.x after running all the tests (I just ran ActiveModel ones), perhaps updating some of the Regexps that were used in the ActiveModel tests and were using ^/$ (many times it seems \\A and \\z were meant to be used) - right now I just added the :multiline option to those (so they work exactly the same as before). I think this change is actually even useful to help make the tests more \"proper\" in the use of Regexps, because ^/$ seem to be used far more often even when \\A and \\z would make more sense.\nAfter merging into 4.x then backport the change into 3.x by changing the exception into a warning.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6052254", "created_at": "2012-06-01T02:16:14Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6569#issuecomment-6052254", "updated_at": "2012-06-01T02:30:18Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6569, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/mrbrdo", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/eda6e2638857d20ae499d26432e1a221?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa767c168a69e9b80282f6d93b32fbb05.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/received_events", "gravatar_id": "eda6e2638857d20ae499d26432e1a221", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "mrbrdo", "type": "User", "id": 167990, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238067dbd3543c15100c91c"}, "id": 6052254, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6569"}
