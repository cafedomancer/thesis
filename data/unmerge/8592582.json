At first, the example totally confused me because you write `revert { create_table ... }` to **drop** the table.  When I read this code, it reads as \"Do the opposite thing of creating a table\", which seems confusing.  I understand the feature, I just wish the code was easier to understand.  Maybe `drop_table` should take a block?", "_id": {"$oid": "523dda17bd354364b900aae7"}, "issue_id": 7627, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8592582", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7627#issuecomment-8592582", "updated_at": "2012-09-16T06:28:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "login": "tenderlove", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-16T06:28:29Z", "id": 8592582, "owner": "rails"}
