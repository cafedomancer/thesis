{"body": "@guilleiguaran For sure there are gems that depend on the availability of `rake stats` such as https://github.com/metricfu/metric_fu which I maintain, but if the removal from rails is complete and is co-ordinated with a 'blessed' code_metrics gem that does the same thing, using the extracted gem would make your experience more consistent, no? Also, I'm not sure that measuring code statistics really should be a part of rails, as I wrote above.\r\n\r\nThat said, how to transition is a good question.  I'm thinking that the gem should have an executable, maybe `code_metrics` and when required, check if Rails is defined before adding the `rake stats` task.  I believe, in that scenario, if the gem is required before rails, when rails loads, it will overwrite the existing task.\r\n\r\nre: [the `rake lines` task, I see that it is also in active_record](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/9a26d94/activerecord/Rakefile#L198) and appears to have been added by @dhh [in 2005 for development purposes](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e0a2dab8166d67c556ab9abc13fb673d2eee1e20).  If that is still required, the gem could be added as a development dependency.\r\n\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20169527", "created_at": "2013-06-28T04:10:40Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11148#issuecomment-20169527", "updated_at": "2013-06-28T04:10:40Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 11148, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/bf4", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/a4e890117ae8877a5c86d5710bfcd594?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc14ca2c02996c1f0dcd65fbbf0142c02.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/received_events", "gravatar_id": "a4e890117ae8877a5c86d5710bfcd594", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "bf4", "type": "User", "id": 142914, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523c9922bd354364b9001892"}, "id": 20169527, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11148"}
