Also, I'm not sure that measuring code statistics really should be a part of rails, as I wrote above.\r\n\r\nThat said, how to transition is a good question.  I'm thinking that the gem should have an executable, maybe `code_metrics` and when required, check if Rails is defined before adding the `rake stats` task.  I believe, in that scenario, if the gem is required before rails, when rails loads, it will overwrite the existing task.\r\n\r\nre: [the `rake lines` task, I see that it is also in active_record](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/9a26d94/activerecord/Rakefile#L198) and appears to have been added by @dhh [in 2005 for development purposes](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e0a2dab8166d67c556ab9abc13fb673d2eee1e20).  If that is still required, the gem could be added as a development dependency.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523c9922bd354364b9001892"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11148#issuecomment-20169527"}
