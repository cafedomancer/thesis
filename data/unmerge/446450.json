So the form will point to an specific URL?\r\n\r\nAnother question is, the reason you first provided this patch is because we had a bug (we were not calling to_model in a place where we were supposed to). Is it still a bug?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time! :D", "_id": {"$oid": "52386ca9bd3543c151012cdc"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/66#issuecomment-446450"}
