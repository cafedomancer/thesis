So the form will point to an specific URL?\r\n\r\nAnother question is, the reason you first provided this patch is because we had a bug (we were not calling to_model in a place where we were supposed to). Is it still a bug?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time! :D", "_id": {"$oid": "52386ca9bd3543c151012cdc"}, "issue_id": 66, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/446450", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/66#issuecomment-446450", "updated_at": "2010-10-04T14:46:09Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2010-10-04T14:46:09Z", "id": 446450, "owner": "rails"}
