You can say some sounds more natural to you than the other, but there is no authoritative English grammar about this that I am aware of.\r\n\r\nForums and opinion of people in the Internet is not enough, you'll find both points of view being argued, and you can also find people convinced that Elvis is alive :).\r\n\r\nThe use case you mention isn't determinant because natural language does not follow logic. for example you say two hundred, not two hundreds. Why? Because that is the way it is. Same with 0 degrees, or 0.1 grams.\r\n\r\nSo, I believe the inflector should remain the same (same resolution would have gone in the opposite situation), and your app should customize it.", "_id": {"$oid": "523806d1bd3543c15100c9ca"}, "issue_id": 6533, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10627982", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6533#issuecomment-10627982", "updated_at": "2012-11-22T09:20:08Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-22T09:18:18Z", "id": 10627982, "owner": "rails"}
