{"body": "I haven't been able to track down the exact cause of LoadError#path being nil in Ruby 2.0. But I was able to reproduce it. Which is why I uploaded this git repo: https://github.com/adamcrown/rails4-rspec-guard-spork. It's a simple new rails app with guard, spork and rspec. If you'll clone the repo and run `bundle exec guard`, you'll see the error. Running rspec directly works fine so it's something to do with spork I think.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to put in whatever legwork to get this resolved as I use rspec, guard and spork with most of my Rails apps. But I hit a bit of a dead end and this was the best solution I could find.
