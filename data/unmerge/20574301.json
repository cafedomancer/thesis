But I was able to reproduce it. Which is why I uploaded this git repo: https://github.com/adamcrown/rails4-rspec-guard-spork. It's a simple new rails app with guard, spork and rspec. If you'll clone the repo and run `bundle exec guard`, you'll see the error. Running rspec directly works fine so it's something to do with spork I think.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to put in whatever legwork to get this resolved as I use rspec, guard and spork with most of my Rails apps. But I hit a bit of a dead end and this was the best solution I could find. Any suggestions are appreciated.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d6fabd3543c151008330"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11259#issuecomment-20574301"}
