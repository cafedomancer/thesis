My question is: what is the threshold at which supporting the IdentityMap is worthwhile? If perhaps we didn't need to run the entire test suite twice and the IM could be made to touch fewer parts of AR, would that lower the maintenance threshold enough?", "_id": {"$oid": "523e4e93bd354364b900ee92"}, "issue_id": 6524, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7310711", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6524#issuecomment-7310711", "updated_at": "2012-07-27T17:10:08Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby", "login": "sskirby", "gravatar_id": "4d4c378e3a10e2d01a636a33c359734c", "html_url": "https://github.com/sskirby", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4d4c378e3a10e2d01a636a33c359734c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6f3e24662182e125fc58299809ee6a67.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 25760, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-27T17:10:08Z", "id": 7310711, "owner": "rails"}
