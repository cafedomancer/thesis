I've been travelling a lot, so I might be stupid at the moment. :)\r\n\r\nFrom [the spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#section-11):\r\n\r\n>  auth-param     = token \"=\" quoted-string\r\n\r\nNow, a `quoted-string` is defined as\r\n\r\n> quoted-string  = ( <\"> *(qdtext) <\"> )\r\n\r\nand a `token` is\r\n\r\n>  token          = 1*&lt;any CHAR except CTLs or tspecials&gt;\r\n\r\n`tspecials` is\r\n\r\n```\r\n tspecials      = \"(\" | \")\" | \"<\" | \">\" | \"@\"\r\n                      | \",\" | \";\" | \":\" | \"\\\" | <\">\r\n                      | \"/\" | \"[\" | \"]\" | \"?\" | \"=\"\r\n                      | \"{\" | \"}\" | SP | HT\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can have either a `token` or a `quoted-string`. A `token` cannot contain `=`, as it's in `tspecials`, and a `quoted-string` requires quotes around its characters. This makes sense; without quotes, it would be ambiguous if you meant a key-value pair or another token. I bet if you sent 3 or 4 params, it would be confused.\r\n\r\nSo no, I do not think this should be merged, at least in its current form.", "_id": {"$oid": "523da2c5bd354364b90088d4"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8208#issuecomment-10584940"}
