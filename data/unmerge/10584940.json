{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8208", "repo": "rails", "body": "It's just that I'm slightly confused as to the exact situations in which this change is important. I've been travelling a lot, so I might be stupid at the moment. :)\r\n\r\nFrom [the spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#section-11):\r\n\r\n>  auth-param     = token \"=\" quoted-string\r\n\r\nNow, a `quoted-string` is defined as\r\n\r\n> quoted-string  = ( <\"> *(qdtext) <\"> )\r\n\r\nand a `token` is\r\n\r\n>  token          = 1*&lt;any CHAR except CTLs or tspecials&gt;\r\n\r\n`tspecials` is\r\n\r\n```\r\n tspecials      = \"(\" | \")\" | \"<\" | \">\" | \"@\"\r\n                      | \",\" | \";\" | \":\" | \"\\\" | <\">\r\n                      | \"/\" | \"[\" | \"]\" | \"?\" | \"=\"\r\n                      | \"{\" | \"}\" | SP | HT\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can have either a `token` or a `quoted-string`. A `token` cannot contain `=`, as it's in `tspecials`, and a `quoted-string` requires quotes around its characters. This makes sense; without quotes, it would be ambiguous if you meant a key-value pair or another token. I bet if you sent 3 or 4 params, it would be confused.\r\n\r\nSo no, I do not think this should be merged, at least in its current form.", "_id": {"$oid": "523da2c5bd354364b90088d4"}, "issue_id": 8208, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10584940", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8208#issuecomment-10584940", "updated_at": "2012-11-21T04:08:03Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "login": "steveklabnik", "gravatar_id": "233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0c22d45f31acf0f4192c8c12b7a55dee.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 27786, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-21T04:07:38Z", "id": 10584940, "owner": "rails"}
