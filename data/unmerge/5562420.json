However, the max wait_timeout value of \"2147483\" only applies when MySQL is run on Windows.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: This pull request should only be accepted if there is any interest in supporting the max wait_timeout of MySQL when run on Windows.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52382be5bd3543c15100f17c"}, "issue_id": 4148, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5562420", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4148#issuecomment-5562420", "updated_at": "2012-05-07T22:21:45Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgonyea/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgonyea/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgonyea/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgonyea/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgonyea", "login": "sgonyea", "gravatar_id": "2206ea5cb493109b3a3a09ad8b7e8be9", "html_url": "https://github.com/sgonyea", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgonyea/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgonyea/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgonyea/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2206ea5cb493109b3a3a09ad8b7e8be9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F56bc6abebad063b0191771f7c0b2501b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgonyea/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 76871, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sgonyea/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-07T22:20:53Z", "id": 5562420, "owner": "rails"}
