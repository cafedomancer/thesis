You should be authenticating your API clients using API tokens, or something like OAuth.  That way both null_session and reset_session are completely harmless to you.\r\n\r\nCSRF protection is designed to protect the session, if you disable it on the login form then an attacker can make a victim log in to an attacker's account. At first glance this seems fine, but the user can then be tricked into associating their CC with that account etc.  This is still something you need to prevent.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ea3ebd3543c151009982"}, "issue_id": 9405, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14080571", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9405#issuecomment-14080571", "updated_at": "2013-02-25T22:35:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-25T22:35:20Z", "id": 14080571, "owner": "rails"}
