That's a standard practice followed in particular by our documentation, and that is part of our documentation guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe docs sometimes use the formula \"Says whether the request is Ajax\" and sometimes \"Returns true if the request is  Ajax\". We do not use \"trueish\" because we should do that in the entire documentation and it reads ugly. And using regular font is a common and enough convention.\r\n\r\nThe type of the returned value is not documented, the contract that you have a predicate that acts as a predicate.\r\n\r\nIn particular, there is no point in saying that `xhr?` returns 0, it's of no use to the user, and it is a detail we do not need to commit to.\r\n\r\nUse the predicate as a predicate.", "_id": {"$oid": "523815d4bd3543c15100dd97"}, "issue_id": 5572, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4682736", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5572#issuecomment-4682736", "updated_at": "2012-03-25T18:28:40Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-25T16:46:10Z", "id": 4682736, "owner": "rails"}
