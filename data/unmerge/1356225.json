While SafeBuffer is a String subclass, that's mostly for erubis and rack compatibility reasons.  In hindsight those reasons aren't really good enough and we could, and probably should, switch to a buffer that doesn't descend from string. \r\n\r\nBasically the buffers aren't meant to be used for all these kinds of operations and attempting to use them should probably be considered a bug in the app.  That's my 'grumpy old man' position on it, but at the same time if there's a nice and elegant fix I'm all for it.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385287bd3543c151011865"}, "issue_id": 1622, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1356225", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1622#issuecomment-1356225", "updated_at": "2011-06-12T21:36:02Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-12T21:36:02Z", "id": 1356225, "owner": "rails"}
