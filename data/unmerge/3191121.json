I'm yet to figure out why exactly that semantic needs to be put in place by httpbis. It doesn't appear to be necessary and it prevents partial idempotent updates (PIUs).\r\n\r\nPIUs are important, particularly for mobile devices that operate on crappy networks and need to be able to make extremely granular requests (i.e. partials) that can be retried easily on failure (i.e. idempotently).\r\n\r\nThe fact is, rails behaves this way - it's demonstrably useful, and non-demonstrably detrimental to either rails applications or the web as a whole.\r\n\r\nI think it's probably better to leave it as it is - given the contention over 2616 - and wait to see what happens with httpbis.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c15101214a"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3191121", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3191121", "updated_at": "2011-12-17T19:55:08Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly", "login": "mikekelly", "gravatar_id": "fddf4e0508e0ab09171063fc13062b85", "html_url": "https://github.com/mikekelly", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/fddf4e0508e0ab09171063fc13062b85?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F425fbd8cd12d7ed14264bdd50d8da0b1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 55782, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-17T19:54:08Z", "id": 3191121, "owner": "rails"}
