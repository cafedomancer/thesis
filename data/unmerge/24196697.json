It doesn't matter that it's duplicated in Rails. Your gem is there for anyone who wants to use this outside of Rails. Then we don't have to bother with integration or deprecation or another dependency.\r\n\r\nOn Sep 10, 2013, at 2:32 PM, Benjamin Fleischer <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> The touch points of the gem within Rails are minimal.\r\n> \r\n> \t\u2022 rake lines and tools/profiler were dev tasks, not surfaced in a release\r\n> \t\u2022 rake stats is now configured much more easily.
