It still seems silly to me that the framework would supply singularization/pluralization defaults that are grammatical exceptions and then tell its users that they can fix it to reflect the actual rule in their own application. To me, it shouldn't be a matter of how many would change those definitions (many of them may not even be _using_ them). I'm trying to leave egos at the door and improve the legitimacy of this area of Rails, but we seem to be in this situation where some poor decisions in the past and \"too many pull requests\" lead to a part of the framework being frozen despite having odd inconsistencies.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380016bd3543c15100bf3b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7071#issuecomment-7051586"}
