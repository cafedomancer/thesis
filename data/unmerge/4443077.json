If you've any ideas on implementing would be good to hear. Any existing tickets out there with further info?\r\n\r\nI'll look into **2)** though it sounds easy enough.\r\n\r\nBiggest concern would be 500.html and 404.html. I've had a think about how this should work...\r\n\r\n* Create a new assets directory `app/assets/static`\r\n* .html files in this directory are pre-processed / rendered (to allow .erb, .haml) extensions etc.\r\n* Generate defaults like app/assets/static/404.html.erb\r\n* files receive same scope for rendering as other assets to allow for digests\r\n* files are rendered to public/assets as normal\r\n* some special handling in the default error handler to render public/assets/404-DIGEST.html instead of public/404.html\r\n\r\nDoes that sound about right? not sure at the minute if there'd be much of an impact on routes  or .htaccess files?\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5238191abd3543c15100e130"}, "issue_id": 5379, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4443077", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5379#issuecomment-4443077", "updated_at": "2012-03-11T22:46:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice", "login": "davidjrice", "gravatar_id": "71f4402df3b4cdc8230e9922d3c5af32", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidjrice", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/71f4402df3b4cdc8230e9922d3c5af32?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fde73998802680548b916f1947ffbad76.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1971, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-11T22:46:04Z", "id": 4443077, "owner": "rails"}
