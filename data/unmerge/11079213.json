{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8419", "repo": "rails", "body": "My point for this commit was to have the *code* of `css_select` reflect its rdoc and its tests, and both rdoc and tests say that `css_select` can only accept one or two arguments (as described above).\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, I too thought that the `@selected` portion of the code was required, in order to write code like:\r\n\r\n    css_select(\"ul\") do\r\n        css_select(\"li\")\r\n    end\r\n\r\nBut this kind of syntax (very similar to `assert_select`) is not contemplated anywhere in the rdoc or tests!\r\n\r\n@rafaelfranca maybe what you have in mind is a different sort of refactor, one that would make `css_select` behave like `assert_select` (excluding the assertions)? We can discuss that too if you want, and find a way to refactor both `css_select` and `assert_select`. For now, I think that the `@selected` part does not belong to `css_select`, since it is not used, tested or documented.
