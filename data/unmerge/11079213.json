We can discuss that too if you want, and find a way to refactor both `css_select` and `assert_select`. For now, I think that the `@selected` part does not belong to `css_select`, since it is not used, tested or documented. What do you think?", "_id": {"$oid": "523d9099bd354364b9007d6b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8419#issuecomment-11079213"}
