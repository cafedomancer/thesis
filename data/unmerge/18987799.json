It will not work as expected in some tricky situations such as #10856.\r\n\r\n`LoggerSilence` still has race conditions. But `ActiveRecord::Migration::CheckPending` is used only in development, so its better to make `LoggerSilence` threadsafe (and include it in ::Logger) instead of trying to avoid it (and bring more complexity).", "_id": {"$oid": "5237db46bd3543c151008823"}, "issue_id": 10836, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18987799", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10836#issuecomment-18987799", "updated_at": "2013-06-05T16:06:38Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/907th/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/907th/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/907th/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/907th/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/907th", "login": "907th", "gravatar_id": "22db129b6a1c2fe478a0dc23de2e8da1", "html_url": "https://github.com/907th", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/907th/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/907th/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/907th/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22db129b6a1c2fe478a0dc23de2e8da1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F177df31366413f8bae7cfefddf0e9962.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/907th/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 800362, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/907th/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-06-05T16:06:38Z", "id": 18987799, "owner": "rails"}
