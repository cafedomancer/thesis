That said, I haven't tried to reproduce this bug yet, so I will try to do it and confirm if this is the best fix.", "_id": {"$oid": "523801b7bd3543c15100c1bf"}, "issue_id": 6941, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6759758", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6941#issuecomment-6759758", "updated_at": "2012-07-04T12:56:31Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus", "login": "drogus", "gravatar_id": "582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30", "html_url": "https://github.com/drogus", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3202111cf90e7c816a472aaceb72b0df.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5004, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-04T12:56:31Z", "id": 6759758, "owner": "rails"}
