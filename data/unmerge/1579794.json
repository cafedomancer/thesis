The fast_xs extension's method doesn't accept the encoding argument that the newer versions of Builder use.  In reality, we're losing an argument by doing this so throwing an exception may be desired instead of this hack, or just not including fast_xs when the argument requirements aren't the same.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384882bd3543c151011169"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2076#issuecomment-1579794"}
