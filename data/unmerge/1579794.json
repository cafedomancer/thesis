{"body": "Yikes, sorry about that - I updated the commit to fix the whitespace issues.\r\n\r\nFrom what I could tell this is a pretty specific issue to active_support where it replaces the Builder to_xs implementation with fast_xs.  The fast_xs extension's method doesn't accept the encoding argument that the newer versions of Builder use.  In reality, we're losing an argument by doing this so throwing an exception may be desired instead of this hack, or just not including fast_xs when the argument requirements aren't the same.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1579794", "created_at": "2011-07-15T13:48:31Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2076#issuecomment-1579794", "updated_at": "2011-07-15T13:49:36Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 2076, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bfolkens/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bfolkens/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bfolkens/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bfolkens", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bfolkens/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/bfolkens", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bfolkens/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c681b5db4f87c37e814dbf5cfdbe18e1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F1e8c391abfde9abea82d75a2d60278d4.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bfolkens/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bfolkens/received_events", "gravatar_id": "c681b5db4f87c37e814dbf5cfdbe18e1", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bfolkens/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "bfolkens", "type": "User", "id": 2154, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bfolkens/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52384882bd3543c151011169"}, "id": 1579794, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2076"}
