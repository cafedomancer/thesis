{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5329", "repo": "rails", "body": "@fxn well, to draw a fair comparison, the [documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/File.html#method-c-world_writable-3F) for `File#world_writeable?` doesn't make claims about returning `true`.\r\n\r\n> If file_name is writable by others, returns an integer representing the file permission bits of file_name. Returns nil otherwise. The meaning of the bits is platform dependent; on Unix systems, see stat(2).\r\n\r\nEven if you accept \"you can't rely on predicate method values to be `true` or `false`\", the documentation between the two examples differ. If the implication in the Rails guidelines you linked to is that `foo?` can be described as returning \"true\" while not returning `true`, then I simply disagree with the guidelines, I suppose.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e21d"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4669943", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4669943", "updated_at": "2012-03-23T23:34:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aprescott/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aprescott/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aprescott/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aprescott/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aprescott", "login": "aprescott", "gravatar_id": "99804651e19d8b0dffbc0da53e39114e", "html_url": "https://github.com/aprescott", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aprescott/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aprescott/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aprescott/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/99804651e19d8b0dffbc0da53e39114e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fec17f0a268ab4e6e5314d1fd38f3a319.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aprescott/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 342081, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aprescott/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-23T23:34:32Z", "id": 4669943, "owner": "rails"}
