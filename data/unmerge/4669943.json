Returns nil otherwise. The meaning of the bits is platform dependent; on Unix systems, see stat(2).\r\n\r\nEven if you accept \"you can't rely on predicate method values to be `true` or `false`\", the documentation between the two examples differ. If the implication in the Rails guidelines you linked to is that `foo?` can be described as returning \"true\" while not returning `true`, then I simply disagree with the guidelines, I suppose.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e21d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4669943"}
