I agree that people tend to think \"model == HTTP resource\" (or not even really think in terms of HTTP resources) and `replace_attributes` may seem to implicitly condone that line of thinking.\r\n\r\nThat said, rails doesn't currently have _anything_ that helps make it easy to implement proper PUT semantics.  If you want to implement proper PUTs you are essentially totally on your own.  Do you have a better suggestion?  (Also, should we take this to another thread? I don't want to derail the discussion here, but it's certainly related).\r\n\r\nAs I see it, `replace_attributes` isn't the perfect answer to HTTP spec or REST compliance any more than the rails scaffolds are.  But it is a tool that can help make it easier to implement proper semantics (FWIW--I implemented this in one of my models on a recent project, and it worked great).", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012173"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3246101"}
