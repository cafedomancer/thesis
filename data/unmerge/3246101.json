{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/505", "repo": "rails", "body": "You bring up good points, @josevalim.  I agree that people tend to think \"model == HTTP resource\" (or not even really think in terms of HTTP resources) and `replace_attributes` may seem to implicitly condone that line of thinking.\r\n\r\nThat said, rails doesn't currently have _anything_ that helps make it easy to implement proper PUT semantics.  If you want to implement proper PUTs you are essentially totally on your own.  Do you have a better suggestion?  (Also, should we take this to another thread? I don't want to derail the discussion here, but it's certainly related).\r\n\r\nAs I see it, `replace_attributes` isn't the perfect answer to HTTP spec or REST compliance any more than the rails scaffolds are.  But it is a tool that can help make it easier to implement proper semantics (FWIW--I implemented this in one of my models on a recent project, and it worked great).", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012173"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3246101", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3246101", "updated_at": "2011-12-22T06:50:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston", "login": "myronmarston", "gravatar_id": "42d4590355a1404230fbc9aff4dd377b", "html_url": "https://github.com/myronmarston", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/42d4590355a1404230fbc9aff4dd377b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6916222172eb021e5d5f0043453078b9.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 49391, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-22T06:50:20Z", "id": 3246101, "owner": "rails"}
