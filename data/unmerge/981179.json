{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/258", "repo": "rails", "body": "#in? has the benefit of being terse yet expressive. #not_in? isn't in the idiom of other Ruby predicates which eschew \"not\" when expressing the negative (e.g., unless, empty, etc.).\n\nSet theory is concerned with \"membership\". Is there an affirming way of saying \"not member of\"? #member_of? is longer than #in? and is semantically equivalent.\nOn Sunday, April 10, 2011 at 2:31 PM, Evan Light wrote: \n> Oops, I meant \"array has object\".
