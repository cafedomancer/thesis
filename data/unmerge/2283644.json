(latest) assets:clean does not initialize the environment so assumes an asset prefix of 'assets'\r\n 2. (previous) assets:clean initializes the wrong environment so assumes the asset prefix of development, rather than the asset prefix definied in production\r\n\r\nI'm kinda at the end of my tether with this task now.  It's going to get refactored.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52383982bd3543c1510100e3"}, "issue_id": 3199, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2283644", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3199#issuecomment-2283644", "updated_at": "2011-10-04T08:24:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjtko/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjtko/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjtko/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjtko/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjtko", "login": "mjtko", "gravatar_id": "be9f8a7e49b430ac89efe1bc8aa1026d", "html_url": "https://github.com/mjtko", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjtko/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjtko/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjtko/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/be9f8a7e49b430ac89efe1bc8aa1026d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F88d16337f620f14a9d05a6b5d459802c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjtko/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 206834, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mjtko/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-10-04T08:24:42Z", "id": 2283644, "owner": "rails"}
