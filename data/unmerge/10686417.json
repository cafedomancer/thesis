{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8307", "repo": "rails", "body": "I desire a concensus around a replacement for \"integration\", whether it be \"requests\" or something else. The viable options from the previous discussion are:\r\n\r\n* requests\r\n* systems\r\n* resources\r\n\r\nThe reasons I think \"requests\" makes the most sense is that it is what rspec-rails uses. That means it has a certain amount of mindshare. It seems to be the strongest name, but I desire a concensus more than any particular name.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, rspec-rails is introducing a new type named \"features\" for tests using Capybara. By separating the ActionDispatch-based tests from the Capybara-based tests it seems to clarify their purpose a bit more IMO. I plan on creating a gem to do something similar with capybara and minitest.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f450bd3543c15100a9e3"}, "issue_id": 8307, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10686417", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8307#issuecomment-10686417", "updated_at": "2012-11-25T02:12:59Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage", "login": "blowmage", "gravatar_id": "cd8da976054ea4915eafc5d9dd096d38", "html_url": "https://github.com/blowmage", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cd8da976054ea4915eafc5d9dd096d38?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd5cfead94f5350c12c322b5b664544c1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 730, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/blowmage/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-25T02:12:59Z", "id": 10686417, "owner": "rails"}
