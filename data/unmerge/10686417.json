The viable options from the previous discussion are:\r\n\r\n* requests\r\n* systems\r\n* resources\r\n\r\nThe reasons I think \"requests\" makes the most sense is that it is what rspec-rails uses. That means it has a certain amount of mindshare. It seems to be the strongest name, but I desire a concensus more than any particular name.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, rspec-rails is introducing a new type named \"features\" for tests using Capybara. By separating the ActionDispatch-based tests from the Capybara-based tests it seems to clarify their purpose a bit more IMO. I plan on creating a gem to do something similar with capybara and minitest.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f450bd3543c15100a9e3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8307#issuecomment-10686417"}
