Also, I think #clean and #deep_clean are terrible names because 'cleaning' can mean anything.  You're removing blanks deeply.  You can always add it as an extension on your own project/s though...\n\nPerhaps I could imagine a set of \"deep\" enumerable methods all of which applied to nested enumerables as well as top level.  \nIf you had those, you could write:\n\n  Person.all.map(&:phone_numbers).reject_deeply(&:blank?)\n\nwhich I think is more expressive than simply #clean.\n\nBut even these I think I'd put in a separate gem as I don't think they are commonly enough needed or relevant enough to rails' purpose to go in rails.... \n", "_id": {"$oid": "523800dcbd3543c15100c063"}, "issue_id": 7008, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6955589", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7008#issuecomment-6955589", "updated_at": "2012-07-13T06:21:36Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/igoodrich/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/igoodrich/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/igoodrich/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/igoodrich/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/igoodrich", "login": "igoodrich", "gravatar_id": "54cf553961a205fd5478adfa4dcde8d6", "html_url": "https://github.com/igoodrich", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/igoodrich/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/igoodrich/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/igoodrich/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/54cf553961a205fd5478adfa4dcde8d6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F142d3279bcb5ba5cca983fcf8d6b6b7e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/igoodrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 102747, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/igoodrich/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-13T06:21:36Z", "id": 6955589, "owner": "rails"}
