Also, I think #clean and #deep_clean are terrible names because 'cleaning' can mean anything.  You're removing blanks deeply.  You can always add it as an extension on your own project/s though...\n\nPerhaps I could imagine a set of \"deep\" enumerable methods all of which applied to nested enumerables as well as top level.  \nIf you had those, you could write:\n\n  Person.all.map(&:phone_numbers).reject_deeply(&:blank?)\n\nwhich I think is more expressive than simply #clean.\n\nBut even these I think I'd put in a separate gem as I don't think they are commonly enough needed or relevant enough to rails' purpose to go in rails.... \n", "_id": {"$oid": "523800dcbd3543c15100c063"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7008#issuecomment-6955589"}
