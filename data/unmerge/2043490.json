{"body": "Hi, thanks for the patch.\r\n\r\nRather than adding a `column_name` param to `references_eager_loaded_table?`, I would prefer that we pass through the exact SQL used by `count`. E.g., I would change the method signature to this:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\ndef references_eager_loaded_table?(sql = to_sql)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then change `count` to pass through the appropriate sql.
