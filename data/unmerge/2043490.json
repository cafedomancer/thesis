E.g., I would change the method signature to this:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\ndef references_eager_loaded_table?(sql = to_sql)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then change `count` to pass through the appropriate sql. Does that sound workable?", "_id": {"$oid": "523f9727bd354364b9019371"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2896#issuecomment-2043490"}
