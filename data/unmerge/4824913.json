{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5328", "repo": "rails", "body": "@gampleman Great pull request but it only seems to work in my case when layout is nil, not when layout is explicitly set to false. I fixed this by changing `action_controller/caching/actions.rb:152` to: \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nhas_layout = !(controller.send(:_layout) == false || controller.send(:_layout).nil?)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to submit another pull request reflecting this change unless you see something wrong with my suggestion. Any issues you can see? Or do you have a more succinct way of implementing this?\r\n\r\nThanks for the great work here gampleman :-)", "_id": {"$oid": "523819c6bd3543c15100e25b"}, "issue_id": 5328, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4824913", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5328#issuecomment-4824913", "updated_at": "2012-03-29T16:16:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh", "login": "nmertaugh", "gravatar_id": "284876426d47fdcddfe1c44ad125bb55", "html_url": "https://github.com/nmertaugh", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/284876426d47fdcddfe1c44ad125bb55?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F78d49e641fbcdebe7a2d0cfad1788b0a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 836301, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-29T16:16:42Z", "id": 4824913, "owner": "rails"}
