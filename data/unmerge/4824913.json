I fixed this by changing `action_controller/caching/actions.rb:152` to: \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nhas_layout = !(controller.send(:_layout) == false || controller.send(:_layout).nil?)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to submit another pull request reflecting this change unless you see something wrong with my suggestion. Any issues you can see? Or do you have a more succinct way of implementing this?\r\n\r\nThanks for the great work here gampleman :-)", "_id": {"$oid": "523819c6bd3543c15100e25b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5328#issuecomment-4824913"}
