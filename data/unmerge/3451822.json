It's a common pattern for backbone.js apps to embed json directly in a &lt;script&gt; tag (in order to avoid an extra round trip to load a model).  I'm agnostic as to whether escaping of \"&lt;/script&gt;\" -> \"&lt;\\/script&gt;\" should happen in to_json (since it doesn't effect json used in other context except &lt;script&gt; tags), but it sure would be nice if there was a helper for it (javascript_json_escape?)", "_id": {"$oid": "52383739bd3543c15100fe1f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3354#issuecomment-3451822"}
