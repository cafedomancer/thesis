It's a common pattern for backbone.js apps to embed json directly in a &lt;script&gt; tag (in order to avoid an extra round trip to load a model).  I'm agnostic as to whether escaping of \"&lt;/script&gt;\" -> \"&lt;\\/script&gt;\" should happen in to_json (since it doesn't effect json used in other context except &lt;script&gt; tags), but it sure would be nice if there was a helper for it (javascript_json_escape?)", "_id": {"$oid": "52383739bd3543c15100fe1f"}, "issue_id": 3354, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3451822", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3354#issuecomment-3451822", "updated_at": "2012-01-11T19:15:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gmcnaughton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gmcnaughton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gmcnaughton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gmcnaughton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gmcnaughton", "login": "gmcnaughton", "gravatar_id": "745c55f201b982c31c610cabab10a6be", "html_url": "https://github.com/gmcnaughton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gmcnaughton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gmcnaughton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gmcnaughton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/745c55f201b982c31c610cabab10a6be?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8ec80169e22b8c57d61c632b5082a319.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gmcnaughton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 78888, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gmcnaughton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-01-11T19:13:43Z", "id": 3451822, "owner": "rails"}
