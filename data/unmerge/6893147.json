One approach to explore is to revise `camelize` to support some new convention (eg hyphen -> underscore), and leave `underscore` as it is. They wouldn't round-trip but they already don't, that seems fine to me.\n\nNot supper happy with ad-hoc conventions like that for `camelize` though. Rails assumes standard naming conventions. While the underscore is a valid character in constant names, class and module names use camel case by convention, no underscores. Not very keen on introducing weird rules for `camelize` to support non-conventional constant names.\n\nTo be honest I don't have a solution that I like right now, but let's discuss and see whether we can do something. /cc @jeremy @josevalim ", "_id": {"$oid": "52380dbabd3543c15100d32a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6105#issuecomment-6893147"}
