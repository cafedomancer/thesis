One approach to explore is to revise `camelize` to support some new convention (eg hyphen -> underscore), and leave `underscore` as it is. They wouldn't round-trip but they already don't, that seems fine to me.\n\nNot supper happy with ad-hoc conventions like that for `camelize` though. Rails assumes standard naming conventions. While the underscore is a valid character in constant names, class and module names use camel case by convention, no underscores. Not very keen on introducing weird rules for `camelize` to support non-conventional constant names.\n\nTo be honest I don't have a solution that I like right now, but let's discuss and see whether we can do something. /cc @jeremy @josevalim ", "_id": {"$oid": "52380dbabd3543c15100d32a"}, "issue_id": 6105, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6893147", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6105#issuecomment-6893147", "updated_at": "2012-07-10T23:21:58Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-10T23:21:58Z", "id": 6893147, "owner": "rails"}
