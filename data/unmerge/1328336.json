{"body": "We built a layer on top of normal prototype-based inheritance that allows you to specify $super as the first parameter to a method and call it to invoke the method from the superclass. Prototype.js uses a similar technique as well. So the uglifier can't know we're planning on using the parameters in this way and we have to tell it. Our module system actually inspects the names of the function parameters when it's setting up our constructors.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1328336", "created_at": "2011-06-08T17:27:29Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1500#issuecomment-1328336", "updated_at": "2011-06-08T17:27:29Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 1500, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/nathansobo", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/bd964c4c26b160867008b423ae92b3e7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fecd62de20ea67e1c2d933d311b08178a.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/received_events", "gravatar_id": "bd964c4c26b160867008b423ae92b3e7", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "nathansobo", "type": "User", "id": 1789, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nathansobo/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238542bbd3543c151011956"}, "id": 1328336, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1500"}
