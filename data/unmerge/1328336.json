Prototype.js uses a similar technique as well. So the uglifier can't know we're planning on using the parameters in this way and we have to tell it. Our module system actually inspects the names of the function parameters when it's setting up our constructors.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238542bbd3543c151011956"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1500#issuecomment-1328336"}
