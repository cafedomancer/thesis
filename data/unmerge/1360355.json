Having reviewed the first commit the example you're changing relates to a chunk of code which should really be pulled - it was added for backwards compatibility with Rails 0.13 environment.rb files and is no longer relevant, so the whole module needs removing. As for the plugin change it doesn't matter since rubyonrails.com redirects to rubyonrails.org and the svn repository is no longer there anyway.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385166bd3543c15101178a"}, "issue_id": 1679, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1360355", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1679#issuecomment-1360355", "updated_at": "2011-06-13T17:16:21Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-13T17:16:21Z", "id": 1360355, "owner": "rails"}
