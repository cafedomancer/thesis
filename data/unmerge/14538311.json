I'm still getting \"undefined method before_action / before_filter\". I was bundling rails 3.2.13.rc2 and also 3.2.12 and in the same exists in both cases. It indeed looks like this has not been released, confirming by the following in a debugging session with those versions of rails:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n[4] pry(TrialMailer)> ActionMailer::Base.included_modules.include?(AbstractController::AssetPaths)\r\n=> true\r\n[5] pry(TrialMailer)> ActionMailer::Base.included_modules.include?(AbstractController::Callbacks)\r\n=> false\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nCan you confirm and/or comment on when this functionality should be available, or help me understand where I've gone wrong.\r\n\r\nThanks.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e8a8bd3543c151009723"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9514#issuecomment-14538311"}
