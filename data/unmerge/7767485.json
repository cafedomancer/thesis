{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7280", "repo": "rails", "body": "Is this a feature to create reversible drop_table? I usually create independent up and down methods when dropping a table, so this feature will save me some lines of code :)\n\nBut why is the \"revert\" method  introduced into the migrations?\n\nWhat about just add the drop_table to the CommandRecorder and to update the CommandRecorder to revert commands with blocks? (I tried to do the udpate on the code but I wasn't able to do that)\n\nSo the syntax will look like:\n\nclass Migration1 < ActiveRecord::Migration\n  def change\n    create_table :users do |t|\n      t.string :name\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nclass Migration2 < ActiveRecord::Migration\n  def change\n    drop_table :users do |t|\n      t.string :name\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nIts just that I don't understand what's the idea behind the revert method.\n\nThx", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fd99bd3543c15100bb76"}, "issue_id": 7280, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7767485", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7280#issuecomment-7767485", "updated_at": "2012-08-15T20:03:56Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rorra/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rorra/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rorra/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rorra/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rorra", "login": "rorra", "gravatar_id": "ac60b044f9171bfd4ec7af3e94ff8fbb", "html_url": "https://github.com/rorra", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rorra/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rorra/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rorra/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ac60b044f9171bfd4ec7af3e94ff8fbb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3b9d6e5e779c8f46c5765c194a04b59a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rorra/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4686, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rorra/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-15T20:03:56Z", "id": 7767485, "owner": "rails"}
