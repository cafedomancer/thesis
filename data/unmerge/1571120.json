It makes the test more verbose, I am not sure if it compensates over the benefit of getting mass assignment exceptions in test.\r\n\r\nThe ActiveResources issue is that ARes always sends the ids on update to the server. Which also causes exceptions when you are using them in development and test. That's why I was thinking that, to fix both dev and test, we could avoid raising exceptions if the only key that is improperly mass assigned is the ID. It isn't a bad approach if we consider that IDs are black listened by default.", "_id": {"$oid": "523848bdbd3543c1510111a2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2067#issuecomment-1571120"}
