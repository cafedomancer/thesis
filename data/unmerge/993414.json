Is it really so bad that we have to leave the English language entirely to find an alternative?!\n\nI know some people find it ugly, but to me, it reads exactly as it should work. With most of the other suggestions, I have do a small mental conversion back to \"not in\".\n\nIt's also the most obvious - I wouldn't need to bother looking up documentation if I ever came across this code in use.\n\nnot_in? just seems more self documenting, just like exclude?, present?, etc.\n\nex? and sans? are not so obvious without the help of an explanation or documentation to justify their use.\n\nThe only caveat, which I somewhat agree with, is that we already have the negation operators '!' and 'not' that already does this. But like much of ruby (and rails) there's more than one way to skin a cat.", "_id": {"$oid": "523863f1bd3543c151012534"}, "issue_id": 265, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/993414", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/265#issuecomment-993414", "updated_at": "2011-04-13T03:20:07Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bayan/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bayan/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bayan/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bayan/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bayan", "login": "bayan", "gravatar_id": "cb51cf7a0d68c0e870a74293479a1813", "html_url": "https://github.com/bayan", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bayan/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bayan/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bayan/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cb51cf7a0d68c0e870a74293479a1813?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7a74d0a59d8d7fa2d696d5a71360d544.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bayan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 103568, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bayan/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-13T03:10:09Z", "id": 993414, "owner": "rails"}
