Although I don't think this is the proper solution. After all, after removing the boundary character from the regexp `\\b`, we could match words that contain just *part* of the uncountable word. Perhaps we want to add `[\\b\\_\\-]` (or even break \\b apart) explicitly instead:\n\n1.9.3-p0-perf :001 > \"fish\" =~ /\\bfish/\n => 0 \n1.9.3-p0-perf :002 > \"sawfish\" =~ /\\bfish/\n => nil \n1.9.3-p0-perf :003 > \"saw_fish\" =~ /\\bfish/\n => nil \n1.9.3-p0-perf :004 > \"saw_fish\" =~ /[\\b\\_\\-]fish/\n => 3 \n\nps: I am not sure if sawfish is a valid word or not, but the idea is just to show a scenario where we could possibly generate invalid matches.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ff99bd3543c15100be60"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7134#issuecomment-7175187"}
