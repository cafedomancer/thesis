I don't have another layer of web server such as nginx, apache to look that up for me. \r\n\r\nI think the best solution here is actually somehow make the rewrite rule from the manifest file. I don't know if it's possible to reload those rewrite rules on-the-fly or not, but if it is possible that might be the best solution for a apache/nginx user.
