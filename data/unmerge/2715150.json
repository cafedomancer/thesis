I was having problems with git pulls on my production server, but thinking it through some files must have gotten out of sync. Logically, the files placed in /app/assets/ get assembled into files in /public/ and they should be the same on the dev server as on the prod server so it shouldn't cause a problem. Better, running 'rake assets:precompile' on the dev box and then pushing to prod server saves doing it there. I've just upgraded to Rails 3.1 and am still getting use to it.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52383449bd3543c15100fb2f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3615#issuecomment-2715150"}
