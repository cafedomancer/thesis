{"body": "OK, I see your point. I was having problems with git pulls on my production server, but thinking it through some files must have gotten out of sync. Logically, the files placed in /app/assets/ get assembled into files in /public/ and they should be the same on the dev server as on the prod server so it shouldn't cause a problem. Better, running 'rake assets:precompile' on the dev box and then pushing to prod server saves doing it there. I've just upgraded to Rails 3.1 and am still getting use to it.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2715150", "created_at": "2011-11-12T00:52:22Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3615#issuecomment-2715150", "updated_at": "2011-11-12T00:54:05Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3615, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/Alamoz", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/acfe9766803c7317f1143d919755d016?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb9293e1a3e6919cf510a787da16875fd.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/received_events", "gravatar_id": "acfe9766803c7317f1143d919755d016", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "Alamoz", "type": "User", "id": 905505, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383449bd3543c15100fb2f"}, "id": 2715150, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3615"}
