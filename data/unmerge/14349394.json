{"body": "@schneems You raise some valid points. The scan over the in memory objects is pretty expensive. Also, I believe it is indeed possible to update the database and not the in-memory object which would lead to some invalid caches.\r\n\r\nTo address the first point, maybe we could implement that target instance variable as a hash instead of an array. The hash would be keyed on the object id, and hold the object. This would make finding an id a lot faster without significantly changing the time to iterate over it or add to the target. \r\n\r\nThe second point of invalid caches seems a lot harder (maybe this is why it wasn't implemented before?). The one solution I can think of (though it probably will take a lot of work), is to enforce a policy of having only one ActiveRecord object per id. If this were implemented correctly, then the only way of changing the database and not the in-memory object would be to use pure SQL for updating, but this case is already unsupported.
