{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6524", "repo": "rails", "body": "@jonleighton it is true that it is possible to structure code in such a way that entities are only loaded once, but this does mean that when modelling your domain you will most likely make have to make concessions in the accuracy of your model.\n\nOther alternatives are to load more information (as @iwiznia mentions) or to iterate over your web of AR objects and set the associations yourself. Even in simple situations, like the one described above, this is tedious and means that implementation details are leaking out of your methods into their clients.\n\nAside from performance, there are also correctness benefits. As has already been mentioned in this thread, it can be confusing to have multiple versions of an entity loaded into memory. When one is modified if all others aren't reloaded then you have the potential for hard to find bugs.\n\nI could also mention that an application running under an IM will find it easier to separate persistence logic from domain logic. This is a great benefit for mid to large sized Rails apps, but I'm not sure if that would sway anyone :P", "_id": {"$oid": "523e4e93bd354364b900ee95"}, "issue_id": 6524, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7429959", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6524#issuecomment-7429959", "updated_at": "2012-08-01T15:11:30Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby", "login": "sskirby", "gravatar_id": "4d4c378e3a10e2d01a636a33c359734c", "html_url": "https://github.com/sskirby", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4d4c378e3a10e2d01a636a33c359734c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6f3e24662182e125fc58299809ee6a67.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 25760, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sskirby/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-01T15:11:30Z", "id": 7429959, "owner": "rails"}
