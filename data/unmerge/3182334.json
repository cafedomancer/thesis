Partial content updates are possible by targeting a separately identified resource with state that overlaps a portion of the larger resource, or by using a different method that has been specifically defined for partial updates (for example, the PATCH method defined in RFC5789).\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c15101213a"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3182334", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3182334", "updated_at": "2011-12-16T20:40:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "login": "steveklabnik", "gravatar_id": "233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0c22d45f31acf0f4192c8c12b7a55dee.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 27786, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-16T20:40:17Z", "id": 3182334, "owner": "rails"}
