{"body": "I love the new syntax, but I'm concerned about the deprecation bit. A lot of people have Rails apps that rely on the dynamic finder syntax; just because it has some problems doesn't mean it should be removed. Instead it might be better to address these problems directly.\r\n\r\nFor example, about the code duplication, it might be sensible to implement the dynamic finders through `ActiveRecord::Relation` if they're so much alike. That would solve the problem of duplication but retain compatibility.\r\n\r\nDynamic finders are really pretty neat; they read like English, they illustrate a cool concept in Ruby, they're easy and straightforward for people to understand. I think Rails would be worse for having them removed, and unless there's a super compelling reason to take them out, I don't see how it hurts to leave them in.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4773314", "created_at": "2012-03-28T17:25:58Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5639#issuecomment-4773314", "updated_at": "2012-03-28T17:25:58Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5639, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/Veraticus", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7668fdefde74e42b48fe657d71cdcc4c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ffaa26d60bb56a66a97ad9ae9849656d5.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7668fdefde74e42b48fe657d71cdcc4c", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "Veraticus", "type": "User", "id": 67038, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Veraticus/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523814d7bd3543c15100dc44"}, "id": 4773314, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5639"}
