I've fixed in: adb8ac153f8e9e497eaecf62165c0bd53c18149a. The reason I didn't just merge you patch is that I wanted to change the implementation a bit, and to add a test. I would usually provide feedback and then wait for you to update the patch, but 3.1.1 is imminent, so I wanted to get a fix out quickly. Hope you don't mind.\r\n\r\nThanks", "_id": {"$oid": "523839d8bd3543c151010133"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3171#issuecomment-2240420"}
