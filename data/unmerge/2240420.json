The reason I didn't just merge you patch is that I wanted to change the implementation a bit, and to add a test. I would usually provide feedback and then wait for you to update the patch, but 3.1.1 is imminent, so I wanted to get a fix out quickly. Hope you don't mind.\r\n\r\nThanks", "_id": {"$oid": "523839d8bd3543c151010133"}, "issue_id": 3171, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2240420", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3171#issuecomment-2240420", "updated_at": "2011-09-29T17:00:50Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "login": "jonleighton", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-09-29T17:00:50Z", "id": 2240420, "owner": "rails"}
