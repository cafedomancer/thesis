I hope you have learned something good for digging in the Rails source code and I hope you can help us more like you did bringing this discussion. :smile:\r\n\r\nCan I close this pull request?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dd1abd3543c151008a7c"}, "issue_id": 10623, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17917116", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10623#issuecomment-17917116", "updated_at": "2013-05-15T02:30:02Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca", "login": "rafaelfranca", "gravatar_id": "0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03", "html_url": "https://github.com/rafaelfranca", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2c7b84fa30f0cea96a90729afe2970a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 47848, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-15T02:30:02Z", "id": 17917116, "owner": "rails"}
