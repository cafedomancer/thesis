Changing this we are changing the API that Action Pack requires to ORMs implement in their errors object. Before it was `[]` now we are changing to `include?` and `[]`.

I hope you have learned something good for digging in the Rails source code and I hope you can help us more like you did bringing this discussion. :smile:\r\n\r\nCan I close this pull request?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dd1abd3543c151008a7c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10623#issuecomment-17917116"}
