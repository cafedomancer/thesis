{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11950", "repo": "rails", "body": "RDoc added support for Markdown in version 4. New Rails projects, however, have sdoc as a documentation dependency in the default _Gemfile_, and that needs RDoc 3 by now (there is work in progress towards RDoc 4). If you check a default _Gemfile.lock_ you'll see RDoc 3 there.\r\n\r\nSo, in order to be able to generate the application API with RDoc 4 you need to remove sdoc from the _Gemfile_, add rdoc, run `bundle update rdoc`, and accept you won't be able to run `doc:api`.\r\n\r\nI believe that the .rdoc extension is the natural default given that context today. You cannot generate stuff that breaks your own features.\r\n\r\nSomeone that does not care about generating local documentation can easily rename the file, the default content is trivial nowadays.\r\n\r\nIn the future I think we are going to migrate to Markdown, but the time has yet to come I believe.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cfeebd3543c151007c03"}, "issue_id": 11950, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/23052545", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11950#issuecomment-23052545", "updated_at": "2013-08-21T21:40:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-08-21T21:39:24Z", "id": 23052545, "owner": "rails"}
