{"body": "@drogus I don't think initializers are black magic at all. I think that people assume getting config into Rails.application.config **is**. Say you write an engine like ActionMailer which is configure in application.rb (or dev/test/rb). It would make sense to put that into the application config instead of an initializer IMO.
