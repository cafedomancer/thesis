{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11808", "repo": "rails", "body": "As @egilburg points out the `hash_for_{route}` methods are old-school - if you know the name of the route you can always get the route object via `Rails.application.routes.named_routes[:name]`. However what you'll get back is a Journey route instance so it won't be as straightforward as doing `route.controller` - the defaults will contain the controller and action.\r\n\r\nI'm closing the PR because it's not the way forward that we want to take - I'm working on refactoring the routing code for 4.1 so I'll consider your needs as part of that process.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d103bd3543c151007d71"}, "issue_id": 11808, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/22456796", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11808#issuecomment-22456796", "updated_at": "2013-08-11T12:14:46Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-08-11T12:14:46Z", "id": 22456796, "owner": "rails"}
