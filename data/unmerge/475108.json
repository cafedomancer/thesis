There are already test cases [here](http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/test/controller/caching_test.rb#L90-94) and [here](http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/test/controller/caching_test.rb#L126-136) for `#caching_allowed?`. Also there is [test case](http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/test/controller/caching_test.rb#L181-184) which shows that status not always `Integer`. But if you want I can provide more specifically test case with status `200 OK`.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!", "_id": {"$oid": "52386afcbd3543c151012b96"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/80#issuecomment-475108"}
