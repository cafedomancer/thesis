{"body": "Hi spastorino! There are already test cases [here](http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/test/controller/caching_test.rb#L90-94) and [here](http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/test/controller/caching_test.rb#L126-136) for `#caching_allowed?`. Also there is [test case](http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/test/controller/caching_test.rb#L181-184) which shows that status not always `Integer`. But if you want I can provide more specifically test case with status `200 OK`.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/475108", "created_at": "2010-10-18T07:51:02Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/80#issuecomment-475108", "updated_at": "2010-10-18T07:51:02Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 80, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krekoten/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krekoten/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krekoten/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/krekoten", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krekoten/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/krekoten", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krekoten/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9fcf314ff09f64dc852ee072499b2c2a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7d729a8f2e49b17139a4677c758dc448.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krekoten/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krekoten/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9fcf314ff09f64dc852ee072499b2c2a", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krekoten/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "krekoten", "type": "User", "id": 150485, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krekoten/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386afcbd3543c151012b96"}, "id": 475108, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/80"}
