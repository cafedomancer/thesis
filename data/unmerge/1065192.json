{"body": "@jaredonline just a quick note about why my implementation is faster:\r\n\r\nWhen we do the `..` form, we're actually creating a range object that we send to the `Array#[]` operator.  That operator then has to turn around and get the limits for the operator (possibly two method calls).  Then our newly created range object is thrown away and left for the GC to clean up.\r\n\r\nWith my implementation, we call one method (`Array#length`) and pass that along with the start of the range to `Array#[]`.  If `Array#[]` returns nil, we create a new array object.  This implementation requires fewer method calls and is nicer to the GC as we don't create extra objects.\r\n\r\nTMYK!  :-D\r\n\r\n<3<3<3<3<3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1065192", "created_at": "2011-04-27T16:16:07Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/317#issuecomment-1065192", "updated_at": "2011-04-27T16:16:07Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 317, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tenderlove", "type": "User", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386255bd3543c1510123e8"}, "id": 1065192, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/317"}
