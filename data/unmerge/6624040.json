I don't give you a bad time if you skip `#prepare`, we'll keep it in Cells anyway. However, Rails could benefit from those \"small, unnecessary methods that just include in reverse order\" here and there ;) Makes it easier to see interfaces and to override those.", "_id": {"$oid": "523803c3bd3543c15100c4b1"}, "issue_id": 6826, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6624040", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6826#issuecomment-6624040", "updated_at": "2012-06-28T08:11:57Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick", "login": "apotonick", "gravatar_id": "0fe13386ba69a128e9fadc19ae9d96be", "html_url": "https://github.com/apotonick", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/0fe13386ba69a128e9fadc19ae9d96be?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fda97f65bd113e490a5fab20c4a69f586.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 10406, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-28T08:11:57Z", "id": 6624040, "owner": "rails"}
