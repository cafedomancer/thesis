Whenever you're working with ActiveRecord model attributes you see this. Attributes can be nil or empty depending on if a user has edited the model.\n\nEven working with the 37signals API (HighRise and Basecamp) it's common for interchangeable nils and empties to turn up in the response.\n\nThere are a number of scenarios for removing empties.\n\n1) Using the console and inspecting records (better diffing and comparing of objects)\n2) Rendering a JSON API\n4) Parsing CSV/DAT files with a lot of headers\n\nI've found a few snippets from other libraries that are similar to what `clean` is trying to do. They are not exact but it's the same `compact` `reject` `blank` pattern.\n\n```ruby\n# activerecord/lib/active_record/railties/databases.rake:603\nActiveRecord::Base.configurations.values_at(*environments).compact.reject { |config| config['database'].blank? }\n\n# formtastic/lib/formtastic/inputs/base/choices.rb:81\n.compact.reject { |i| i.blank? }.join(\"_\")\n\n# bundler-1.1.3/lib/bundler.rb:307:        \npaths = possibles.flatten.compact.uniq.reject { |p| p.empty? }\n```\n\nFrom my own projects here are some snippets.\n\nWorking with data logger file for a local school solar project. Over 500 headers and only about 20 or so records needed for the data record model.\n\n```ruby\n  task :import => :environment do\n    # data looks like this\n    # '', '',,'',,,,,,'',,123.1,,,1,'','',,\n    CSV.foreach(File.open('tmp/15min.dat', 'r'), :headers => true) do |line|\n      DataRecord.new(line.to_hash.reject { |k,v| v.blank? && !v.is_a?(FalseClass) })\n    end\n  end\n```\n\nExpose customer phone numbers via JSON API \n\n```ruby\n@phone_numbers = Person.limit(100).map(&:phone_numbers).reject { |k,v| v.is_a?(Array) ? v.compact! && v.empty? : v.empty? }\n\nrespond_to do |format|\n   format.json { render :json => @phone_numbers.to_json }\nend\n```\n\nI agree if that not everything should go into Active Support. I don't want to beat a dead horse if others don't think it's useful. Just trying to articulate as best I can why I think it should be added.\n\nI appreciate the feedback. \n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523800dcbd3543c15100c068"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7008#issuecomment-6985460"}
