If I'm not wrong, using `config.foo = Foo` in this case would set the configs straight to the module instead of a deferred object to be initialized later in the process - that is how I've been seeing this setup - unsure if that's the way to go. Also, not all engines will require a config object.\r\n\r\n@drogus could you take a look on this one?
