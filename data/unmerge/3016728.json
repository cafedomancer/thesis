Actually, my fixes are in my_fix_for_fixture_classes branch.\r\n\r\nI've noticed some other unclear behavior.  I think there need to be methods for the conversions fixture/name <-> table_name <-> ClassName.  Sometimes it is not clear whether a fixture or table name has to be a string, a symbol, or can be both.  Also `set_fixture_class` currently accepts both class constants and their names:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nset_fixture_class :client => User, :organization => \"Company\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wonder if this is not redundant in tests, and if it wouldn't be enough to only accept class constants, but this would break the current functionality, so it can only be considered for a separate patch.", "_id": {"$oid": "523f4de5bd354364b9016b01"}, "issue_id": 3844, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3016728", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3844#issuecomment-3016728", "updated_at": "2011-12-23T10:58:54Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov", "login": "alexeymuranov", "gravatar_id": "63c72161fba6e27cb05c078651c5e969", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexeymuranov", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/63c72161fba6e27cb05c078651c5e969?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F063888cd6044f1607e923c4b12d136f8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 712698, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexeymuranov/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-05T13:11:29Z", "id": 3016728, "owner": "rails"}
