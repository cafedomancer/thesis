It takes a list of sensible elements, and changes some to make no sense.  It is a bug.\n\nMy patch takes directory names and turns them into filenames -- it takes elements that are passed in that \"make no sense\" and attempts to make sense of them.\n\nThe latter is the behavior described at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#using-index-files -- assets can be referred to/asked for by directory, and Rails/Sprockets will attempt to use index.* files inside such directories.", "_id": {"$oid": "523805a8bd3543c15100c7ab"}, "issue_id": 6662, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6212683", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6662#issuecomment-6212683", "updated_at": "2012-06-08T20:46:13Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emersonrp/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emersonrp/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emersonrp/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emersonrp/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emersonrp", "login": "emersonrp", "gravatar_id": "e74788860015ac3a1484634ddd844939", "html_url": "https://github.com/emersonrp", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emersonrp/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emersonrp/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emersonrp/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e74788860015ac3a1484634ddd844939?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0bb024ec9ee9d2d5811f09b7b9b5fec8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emersonrp/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 307232, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emersonrp/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-08T20:46:13Z", "id": 6212683, "owner": "rails"}
