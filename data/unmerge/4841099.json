{"body": "So we had various discussions about this amongst the core team.\r\n\r\nIn 13b3c77e393b8fb02588f39e6bfa10c832e251ff I have added `Relation#find_by` and `Relation#find_by!` to provide this sort of functionality.\r\n\r\nIn terms of deprecating dynamic finders, it was felt that the single-column variant should definitely stay:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nPerson.find_by_name('Jon')\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, if we only did that we wouldn't need to use `method_missing`, we could just define the `find_by_` methods when all the other attribute methods get defined.\r\n\r\nHowever, David was keen to keep the multi-column variant also:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nPerson.find_by_first_name_and_last_name('Jon', 'Leighton')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI personally don't agree that that is nicer than:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nPerson.find_by first_name: 'Jon', last_name: 'Leighton'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut for the moment, `find_by_*` and `find_by_*!` will stay.\r\n\r\nIt was however agreed to deprecate all the other dynamic finder variants:\r\n\r\n* `find_or_initialize_by_*`\r\n* `find_or_create_by_*`\r\n* `find_all_by_*`\r\n* `find_last_by_*`\r\n* `scoped_by_*`\r\n\r\nThese will be extracted into a plugin to make upgrading less painful.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4841099", "created_at": "2012-03-30T12:00:36Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5639#issuecomment-4841099", "updated_at": "2012-03-30T12:00:36Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5639, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jonleighton", "type": "User", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523814d7bd3543c15100dc5a"}, "id": 4841099, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5639"}
