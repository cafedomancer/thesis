Which is a best practice in any language/app.\r\n\r\nDo Rails have all `?` methods returning `true` or `false`? Does this breaks the pattern? If so, this is a no brainer. But I really doubt that this is the case.\r\n\r\nOn another hand, I personally I agree that returning `true` or `false` is more straight forward and the expected behavior, and this PR doesn't break **anything**, why not accept it?\r\n\r\nSometimes it feels like core team is always highly defensive about core rails code. :trollface:", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e218"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4669808", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4669808", "updated_at": "2012-03-23T23:24:05Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krsmurata/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krsmurata/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krsmurata/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krsmurata/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/krsmurata", "login": "krsmurata", "gravatar_id": "e68278c0366608ccf088b7b67cd8d566", "html_url": "https://github.com/krsmurata", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krsmurata/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krsmurata/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krsmurata/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e68278c0366608ccf088b7b67cd8d566?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff58c9875ac84dfe1fbe91b918773d050.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krsmurata/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4591, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/krsmurata/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-23T23:21:40Z", "id": 4669808, "owner": "rails"}
