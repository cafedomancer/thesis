Which is a best practice in any language/app.\r\n\r\nDo Rails have all `?` methods returning `true` or `false`? Does this breaks the pattern? If so, this is a no brainer. But I really doubt that this is the case.\r\n\r\nOn another hand, I personally I agree that returning `true` or `false` is more straight forward and the expected behavior, and this PR doesn't break **anything**, why not accept it?\r\n\r\nSometimes it feels like core team is always highly defensive about core rails code. :trollface:", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e218"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4669808"}
