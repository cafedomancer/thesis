I really just want to disable the fragment cache for previews ... is there not some way I can do this in the view or the controller?\n\nUpdate: I realized I can just do `expire_fragment(@sale)` in my controller but I still think this is a good use case for conditional caching. I'd love to just be able to do\n```\n<% cache @model do %>\n  blah blah\n<% end if @model.persisted? %>\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "523818cbbd3543c15100e0da"}, "issue_id": 5396, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6049937", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5396#issuecomment-6049937", "updated_at": "2012-05-31T23:23:44Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swrobel/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swrobel/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swrobel/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swrobel/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/swrobel", "login": "swrobel", "gravatar_id": "04ed2b23acc1400315dd1fb5f364b065", "html_url": "https://github.com/swrobel", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swrobel/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swrobel/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swrobel/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/04ed2b23acc1400315dd1fb5f364b065?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8ceb181e56373d4c5c65158a8c34abd2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swrobel/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 157270, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/swrobel/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-31T23:09:28Z", "id": 6049937, "owner": "rails"}
