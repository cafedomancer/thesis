One, I know that folks at twitter use Rails 3.2.x with mysql (and won't use mysql2).  So there are > 0 users of the mysql adapter.  The second reason is that it's likely that I'll end up maintaining the adapter, and it's just easier for me to maintain it while it's in core.\r\n\r\nIf this is just to break it out of core, but no maintainer is volunteering, then :-1:.  To casual observers, it may seem strange that we ship to mysql adapters, but I know for a fact that people use both mysql and mysql2.  Which means this becomes a question of \"who will maintain the adapter?\".\r\n\r\nCurrently the answer is @tenderlove.  If the answer is to remain @tenderlove, then we should not remove this from core.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380feebd3543c15100d5e0"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6030#issuecomment-10869464"}
