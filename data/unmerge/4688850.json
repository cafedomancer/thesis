{"body": ":thumbsup: let's forget the semantics and just face the fact that, regardless of whether or not both might technically be correct.. it's already been demonstrated that **in this particular instance** returning actual `true` or `false` is a performance benefit on at least two popular implementations of Ruby. That's not always `true` (or even true or `0` :grin:), but in this case it is. Since `true` and `false` are just as \"truthy\" and \"falsy\" as `0` and `nil` and either version is easy to read and understand, why not go with the version that's faster?\r\n\r\n:shipit:", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4688850", "created_at": "2012-03-26T07:06:26Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4688850", "updated_at": "2012-03-26T07:08:29Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5580, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/stevenh512", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b3e25a674fe385ec5d985c8adf8d60aa?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Feb5bc262e55ae62defb5de04c8848a90.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/received_events", "gravatar_id": "b3e25a674fe385ec5d985c8adf8d60aa", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "stevenh512", "type": "User", "id": 110500, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd38"}, "id": 4688850, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5580"}
