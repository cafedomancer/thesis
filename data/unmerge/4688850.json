That's not always `true` (or even true or `0` :grin:), but in this case it is. Since `true` and `false` are just as \"truthy\" and \"falsy\" as `0` and `nil` and either version is easy to read and understand, why not go with the version that's faster?\r\n\r\n:shipit:", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd38"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4688850"}
