I'm not sure why we can't make SQLite pretend to deal with time columns.  Technically SQLite3 doesn't support [time, datetime, booleans, or much of anything](http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html).  It seems that if we're faking these datatypes in sqlite3, we may as well fake time.\n\nCan you figure out what would break if we revert just the `sqlite3_adapter.rb` file?  What's the impact?", "_id": {"$oid": "523803a7bd3543c15100c477"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6835#issuecomment-6528485"}
