{"body": "@mauricio we could possible revert that PR.  I'm not sure why we can't make SQLite pretend to deal with time columns.  Technically SQLite3 doesn't support [time, datetime, booleans, or much of anything](http://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html).  It seems that if we're faking these datatypes in sqlite3, we may as well fake time.\n\nCan you figure out what would break if we revert just the `sqlite3_adapter.rb` file?
