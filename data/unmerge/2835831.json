{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3714", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks Jose. I understand your point and where you're coming from, especially regarding complexity.\r\n\r\nHowever what options do I have for passing parameters to methods for serialization?\r\n\r\nI can think of a few:\r\n1. Pass parameters to Model via attr_accessible. But this isn't good OOP and messy.\r\n2. Use controller variables in my model. But this basically the same as #1.\r\n3. Use `serializable_hash` then `merge` the method with parameters, passing the resulting hash into `render json:` or `render xml:`. This seems too complex for something as simple as passing parameters to a method.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I need to basically pass `current_user` information (using Devise [thanks for that gem btw!]) to the Model. Is there some gem or method that I'm missing? Or is option #3 the preferred way of doing this?", "_id": {"$oid": "523832bebd3543c15100f901"}, "issue_id": 3714, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2835831", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3714#issuecomment-2835831", "updated_at": "2011-11-22T15:42:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tazsingh/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tazsingh/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tazsingh/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tazsingh/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tazsingh", "login": "tazsingh", "gravatar_id": "817064769d0316491e902fc65ac0e742", "html_url": "https://github.com/tazsingh", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tazsingh/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tazsingh/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tazsingh/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/817064769d0316491e902fc65ac0e742?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd6403b0b8a58ff7a6328bddc0f106394.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tazsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 397824, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tazsingh/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-22T15:42:15Z", "id": 2835831, "owner": "rails"}
