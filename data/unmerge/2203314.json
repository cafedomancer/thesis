I initially created a class called ConsoleTools that held these methods, but it seemed inelegant to have a class that is loaded on my production servers but is only ever used in the console.  I later discovered that other people wanted this feature as well (http://railsbros.de/2010/11/29/a-custom-irbrc-for-rails-3.html) and had just reopened `Rails::Application` to do the needful.  Having methods in the global namespace is nice on the console for readability and minimizing keystrokes.\r\n\r\nI don't currently use any of my app classes in my `console.rb`-- perhaps one day I'll need to, but not yet.  Here's my current `console.rb`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef show_log\r\n  change_log(STDOUT)\r\nend\r\n\r\ndef hide_log\r\n  change_log(nil)\r\nend\r\n\r\ndef change_log(stream)\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base.logger = ::Logger.new(stream)\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base.clear_all_connections!\r\nend\r\n\r\ndef s(string, length, left_aligned = true)\r\n  \"%#{left_aligned ? '-' : ''}#{length}s\" % string\r\nend\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "52383a3bbd3543c151010189"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3139#issuecomment-2203314"}
