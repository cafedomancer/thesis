{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3139", "repo": "rails", "body": "I've found it useful for those bits of code that are only ever needed in the console, but that you want to be available to any instance of your project (that's why `.ircrb` doesn't suffice).  I initially created a class called ConsoleTools that held these methods, but it seemed inelegant to have a class that is loaded on my production servers but is only ever used in the console.  I later discovered that other people wanted this feature as well (http://railsbros.de/2010/11/29/a-custom-irbrc-for-rails-3.html) and had just reopened `Rails::Application` to do the needful.  Having methods in the global namespace is nice on the console for readability and minimizing keystrokes.\r\n\r\nI don't currently use any of my app classes in my `console.rb`-- perhaps one day I'll need to, but not yet.  Here's my current `console.rb`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef show_log\r\n  change_log(STDOUT)\r\nend\r\n\r\ndef hide_log\r\n  change_log(nil)\r\nend\r\n\r\ndef change_log(stream)\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base.logger = ::Logger.new(stream)\r\n  ActiveRecord::Base.clear_all_connections!\r\nend\r\n\r\ndef s(string, length, left_aligned = true)\r\n  \"%#{left_aligned ? '-' : ''}#{length}s\" % string\r\nend\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "52383a3bbd3543c151010189"}, "issue_id": 3139, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2203314", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3139#issuecomment-2203314", "updated_at": "2011-09-26T20:15:06Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak", "login": "rroblak", "gravatar_id": "16f606d6f3cd4f7b742ec0d6db1674bf", "html_url": "https://github.com/rroblak", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/16f606d6f3cd4f7b742ec0d6db1674bf?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4df49b56bc16bcda30bb2dac13bce603.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 103835, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rroblak/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-09-26T20:15:06Z", "id": 2203314, "owner": "rails"}
