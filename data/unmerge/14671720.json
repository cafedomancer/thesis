But when we remove those `.where()`, `.limit()` or `any_scope` invocations, we do need add `all` scope. I think it's weird a bit.\r\n\r\nSo, like this:\r\n\r\n    Model.published.limit(5).each {}\r\n    Model.each {}\r\n\r\nAnd surely I'd like to hear more feedback, maybe this change is useful only for me.
