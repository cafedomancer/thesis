{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9635", "repo": "rails", "body": "@carlosantoniodasilva `find_each` and `find_in_batches` both are separate family of scopes, this `each` has nothing relative with them. \r\n\r\nI tried to make something like `where` or `limit`: we don't actually need to use it like `Model.all.where().each`, we just use `Model.where().each`, `Model.limit().each`, and `Model.any_scope.each`. But when we remove those `.where()`, `.limit()` or `any_scope` invocations, we do need add `all` scope. I think it's weird a bit.\r\n\r\nSo, like this:\r\n\r\n    Model.published.limit(5).each {}\r\n    Model.each {}\r\n\r\nAnd surely I'd like to hear more feedback, maybe this change is useful only for me.
