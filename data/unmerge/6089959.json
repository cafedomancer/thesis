Of course, you might need to touch code in the individual connection adapters.\n\nYou'll probably want to search old issues and tickets to see if this has been attempted before.  It could be that it was attempted and rejected previously.\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52385e38bd3543c151012046"}, "issue_id": 561, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6089959", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/561#issuecomment-6089959", "updated_at": "2012-06-03T23:10:01Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jpalermo/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jpalermo/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jpalermo/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jpalermo/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jpalermo", "login": "jpalermo", "gravatar_id": "edd7219b682c851981e454b7b08e7579", "html_url": "https://github.com/jpalermo", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jpalermo/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jpalermo/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jpalermo/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/edd7219b682c851981e454b7b08e7579?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7081a9ee5d50032dc5537accf39da060.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jpalermo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 16798, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jpalermo/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-03T23:10:01Z", "id": 6089959, "owner": "rails"}
