I've added a flag to detect whether an EXPLAIN is happening or not, which is now included in the runtime registry. Now the ``finish`` method checks to see if ``collecting_queries_flag`` is true or not, before it appends the parse payload.\r\n\r\nNow, calling ``save_available_queries`` will set the ``collecting_queries_flag`` to true, and the ``restore_available_queries`` method will set the flag to false.", "_id": {"$oid": "523cf0b6bd354364b9003550"}, "issue_id": 10198, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16343411", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10198#issuecomment-16343411", "updated_at": "2013-04-14T00:14:58Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn", "login": "wangjohn", "gravatar_id": "ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab", "html_url": "https://github.com/wangjohn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1075780, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-04-14T00:14:58Z", "id": 16343411, "owner": "rails"}
