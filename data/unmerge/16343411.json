I've added a flag to detect whether an EXPLAIN is happening or not, which is now included in the runtime registry. Now the ``finish`` method checks to see if ``collecting_queries_flag`` is true or not, before it appends the parse payload.\r\n\r\nNow, calling ``save_available_queries`` will set the ``collecting_queries_flag`` to true, and the ``restore_available_queries`` method will set the flag to false.", "_id": {"$oid": "523cf0b6bd354364b9003550"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10198#issuecomment-16343411"}
