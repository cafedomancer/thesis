{"body": "Why not to let MySQL use its default value instead?\r\n\r\nI think we shouldn't set any value here and let MySQL take care of that. We should set the `wait_timeout` through the adapter only if that value is specified in the database.yml file. In this case we should validate only if it is a `Fixnum` and let the user handle the range because it could depend on the server version or the platform.  \r\n\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3316763", "created_at": "2011-12-30T20:22:09Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4148#issuecomment-3316763", "updated_at": "2011-12-30T20:22:09Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 4148, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/Juanmcuello", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f63a259f9b2375e2e900b8cfcc1420fd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ab50a3e04f83906aac563629a76f88d.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f63a259f9b2375e2e900b8cfcc1420fd", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "Juanmcuello", "type": "User", "id": 112913, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52382be4bd3543c15100f17a"}, "id": 3316763, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/4148"}
