We should set the `wait_timeout` through the adapter only if that value is specified in the database.yml file. In this case we should validate only if it is a `Fixnum` and let the user handle the range because it could depend on the server version or the platform.  \r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52382be4bd3543c15100f17a"}, "issue_id": 4148, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3316763", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4148#issuecomment-3316763", "updated_at": "2011-12-30T20:22:09Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello", "login": "Juanmcuello", "gravatar_id": "f63a259f9b2375e2e900b8cfcc1420fd", "html_url": "https://github.com/Juanmcuello", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f63a259f9b2375e2e900b8cfcc1420fd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ab50a3e04f83906aac563629a76f88d.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 112913, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Juanmcuello/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-30T20:22:09Z", "id": 3316763, "owner": "rails"}
