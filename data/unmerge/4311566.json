I wanted `CascadeStore` to live under that directory so that it's easy to discover when developers are researching for available cache stores. Since this store doesn't have any backing datastore behind it, it'd be harder for developers to find it even if it fits their problem.\r\n\r\nThat said, I see how it can really go either way. For example, the [redis-store](https://github.com/jodosha/redis-store) gem provides a cache store.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381a9abd3543c15100e339"}, "issue_id": 5263, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4311566", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5263#issuecomment-4311566", "updated_at": "2012-03-04T17:54:01Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jch/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jch/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jch/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jch/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jch", "login": "jch", "gravatar_id": "acd4b5803e806bf0ed70299f15cd6d18", "html_url": "https://github.com/jch", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jch/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jch/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jch/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/acd4b5803e806bf0ed70299f15cd6d18?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa1af768d3b16885b8eb893d58712c1ea.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jch/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 19874, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jch/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-04T17:54:01Z", "id": 4311566, "owner": "rails"}
