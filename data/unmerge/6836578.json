{"body": "@mkraft random ordering yes, getting the first \"random\" record might not be, as you've just implemented it with a nice technique :).\n\n@derek-watson thanks for the great addition related to performance.\n\nAt the end, I think we all agree that returning a Relation would be the best solution, allowing to return only one or as many records as required, giving more control to the caller :)\n\nAnyway, since we're all talking about a feature request / addition to the core, I'd like to invite all of you to continue the discussion on Ruby on Rails Core mailing list - a proper place for us to have a conversation about feature requests / additions. @mkraft please feel free to post a message there, pointing to this issue, so we can get even more feedback from others, and implementation ideas. I'm closing the issue, since it's not \"an issue\".
