I'll take a look at it tomorrow morning and see how we go.\r\n\r\nAs for associations, yes, good idea.  For that I would request you post your idea to rails-core and have a discussion on the implementation first.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work, look forward to your pull request tomorrow morning my time :)\r\n\r\nMikel", "_id": {"$oid": "52386dd9bd3543c151012dac"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37#issuecomment-432375"}
