{"body": "Hi there Gramos,\r\n\r\nI totally forgot about this.\r\n\r\nIf you could rebase against master without the merge, and do another pull request, that would be fantastic.  I'll take a look at it tomorrow morning and see how we go.\r\n\r\nAs for associations, yes, good idea.  For that I would request you post your idea to rails-core and have a discussion on the implementation first.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work, look forward to your pull request tomorrow morning my time :)\r\n\r\nMikel", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/432375", "created_at": "2010-09-27T16:03:28Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37#issuecomment-432375", "updated_at": "2010-09-27T16:03:28Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 37, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikel/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikel/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikel/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikel", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikel/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/mikel", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikel/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/fb1a6916e06f221b5b53a6665f9858eb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F07f75d9144912970de5a09f5a305e10c.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikel/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikel/received_events", "gravatar_id": "fb1a6916e06f221b5b53a6665f9858eb", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikel/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "mikel", "type": "User", "id": 3366, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikel/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386dd9bd3543c151012dac"}, "id": 432375, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/37"}
