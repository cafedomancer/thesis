{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/505", "repo": "rails", "body": "@mikekelly From what I can tell, it's clear that PUT means full-resource updates, and the purpose of RFC 5789 (PATCH) is not mainly to clarify PUT's definition (it does clarify, if only by taking for granted that PUT is full-resource replacement), but to provide a solution for a glaring hole in HTTP--namely, the lack of partial updates.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that PATCH does not guarantee idempotent updates. I agree with you it might be useful to have a verb that allows partial and idempotent updates. However, PUT is not it (no partial updates). Neither is PATCH (updates not guaranteed to be idempotent). There is no verb in HTTP that guarantees idempotent behavior while allowing partial updates.\r\n\r\nYour desire for such a verb should not prevent PATCH from being supported in Rails. As for idempotent partial updates, it seems like using subresources (as discussed in previous comments) is the best strategy for now.\r\n\r\nAfter all this, though, it seems we're pretty much on the same page. I think you'd agree it would be good to support PATCH in Rails if it's clear that PUT does not allow partial updates. Our task, then, is to ascertain whether or not PUT supports partial updates. And between RFCs (new and old) and Roy Fielding, it seems pretty clear the authorities are against partial updates in PUT.
