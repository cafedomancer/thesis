Even better, forking multi-process have true concurrency utilizing multi-cores on MRIs with GIL. My point is that, by the time truly CoW-friendly GC is available on MRI, writing thread-safe code - again, I'd strees that's **for request concurrency** - would be less beneficial, just adding code complexity.\n\nBut practically speaking, I wouldn't hope too much on CoW-friendly GC to work 100% as advertised, so I'd imagine myself using Puma for some projects, Unicorn for the other, and of course Celluloid for some. :)", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c72b"}, "issue_id": 6685, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6496220", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6496220", "updated_at": "2012-06-21T22:42:08Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn", "login": "kenn", "gravatar_id": "f3c42aa7989a9a0c37709abc08a6327f", "html_url": "https://github.com/kenn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f3c42aa7989a9a0c37709abc08a6327f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F20d749bc05f47d2bd3026ce457dcfd8e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 10350, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-21T22:29:44Z", "id": 6496220, "owner": "rails"}
