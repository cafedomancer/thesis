{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6105", "repo": "rails", "body": "Sure, the original ticket shows modules with underscores do not work under some circumstances. At first sight seem to be those where Rails starts with a string to come up with a constant name via `camelize`.\n\nSo, the situation is that modules with underscores work today in some use cases, and do not work in some others.\n\nBut the proposed solution would break existing Rails applications where constant names with underscores are used in a way that works. I believe we need to think of another solution because of that.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380dbabd3543c15100d328"}, "issue_id": 6105, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6868608", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6105#issuecomment-6868608", "updated_at": "2012-07-10T07:18:53Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-10T07:18:53Z", "id": 6868608, "owner": "rails"}
