I like the idea of something that works reverse of #include? for certain situations. #avoids? works well, in my mind (for readability), but only in a limited set of contexts. \r\n\r\nuser.password.avoids?(*weak_passwords) makes a good amount of sense to me.\r\n2.avoids?(*odd_numbers), and most other contexts, does not.\r\n\r\n2.is_not?(odd) makes sense, but that odd variable, on it's own, is obfuscated.\r\n\r\nThe best alternatives I've come up with are #contradicts?, #contrasts?, and #counters?, with #negates? in a distance fourth. None are overwhelmingly meaningful.
