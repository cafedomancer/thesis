{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7627", "repo": "rails", "body": "I understand better now.  Thanks for the explanation.\r\n\r\nHowever, since other migration actions (`create_table`, `add_column`, `remove_column`, `add_index`, `remove_index`) can be reverted without the needing to be wrapped in a `revert` block, why not just change `drop_table` itself to be revertible similar to the other methods?  It seems awkward to require a `revert` block for one DB action and none others.\r\n\r\nI would propose something like this instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef change\r\n  # Copied straight from your first migration:\r\n  drop_table :users do |t|\r\n    t.string :username, null: false\r\n    t.string :encrypted_password, null: false\r\n    t.string :first_name\r\n    t.string :last_name\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe block can be optional (i.e.: `drop_table :users` would still work, it just would not be revertible).  But by supplying the block, you can now revert that action just like any other action, plus the syntax is more in line with other migration methods.", "_id": {"$oid": "523dda17bd354364b900aaf1"}, "issue_id": 7627, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9834744", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7627#issuecomment-9834744", "updated_at": "2012-10-27T11:37:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins", "login": "mhuggins", "gravatar_id": "781f66c42983ae7ee3123bbd620d8568", "html_url": "https://github.com/mhuggins", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/781f66c42983ae7ee3123bbd620d8568?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8cc10a343f7cacddbbc5488786f3f22b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 169093, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-27T11:35:49Z", "id": 9834744, "owner": "rails"}
