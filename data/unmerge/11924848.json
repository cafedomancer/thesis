However, asset URLs within a mounted engine should use the *app's* `SCRIPT_NAME`, but that info is not available to the engine (yet).\r\n\r\nHow about exposing a new Rack env var for the root asset path? The app (or sprockets?) would set the root asset path based on `SCRIPT_NAME` and the engine wouldn't modify it.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f0acbd3543c15100a319"}, "issue_id": 8712, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11924848", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8712#issuecomment-11924848", "updated_at": "2013-01-06T05:54:33Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy", "login": "jeremy", "gravatar_id": "24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremy", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84d9ee44e457ddef7f2c4f25dc8fa865.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 199, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-06T05:54:33Z", "id": 11924848, "owner": "rails"}
