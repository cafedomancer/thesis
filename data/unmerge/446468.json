I had thought that allowing the instance to override its class's default model_name might be an acceptable workaround to the immutable copy at the class level, but if the immutable \"model name\" is in fact a philosophical decision, beyond just a technical one, then I can see that having an instance method called \"model name\" is at the very least misleading.\r\n\r\nYes, I wanted to override the default destination URL. My initial attempt was to catch it in an override to :url in apply_form_for_options! instead, but it wasn't working at the time.... I got sidetracked when debugging that problem when I saw the apparently missing to_model call that started the initial discussion -- which, to answer your second question, is still (I think) a bug.", "_id": {"$oid": "52386ca9bd3543c151012cdd"}, "issue_id": 66, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/446468", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/66#issuecomment-446468", "updated_at": "2010-10-04T15:00:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie", "login": "ernie", "gravatar_id": "2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542", "html_url": "https://github.com/ernie", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6a600c968f4e6a843dcaf600c1694e42.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 14947, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2010-10-04T15:00:42Z", "id": 446468, "owner": "rails"}
