I had thought that allowing the instance to override its class's default model_name might be an acceptable workaround to the immutable copy at the class level, but if the immutable \"model name\" is in fact a philosophical decision, beyond just a technical one, then I can see that having an instance method called \"model name\" is at the very least misleading.\r\n\r\nYes, I wanted to override the default destination URL. My initial attempt was to catch it in an override to :url in apply_form_for_options! instead, but it wasn't working at the time.... I got sidetracked when debugging that problem when I saw the apparently missing to_model call that started the initial discussion -- which, to answer your second question, is still (I think) a bug.", "_id": {"$oid": "52386ca9bd3543c151012cdd"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/66#issuecomment-446468"}
