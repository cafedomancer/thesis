The word \"rest\" doesn't really stand on its own; the \"rest\" of something could be various different things depending on the context.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that in general we try not to add things to AS unless they are going to be used inside Rails core, or they are very obviously useful to a large number of Rails developers. I don't think this fits in either of those categories.\r\n\r\nHowever, maybe others will chip in and disagree with me...", "_id": {"$oid": "52381250bd3543c15100d92b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5836#issuecomment-5125877"}
