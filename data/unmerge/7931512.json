{"body": "The test you are changing says explicitly that it *shouldn't* be namespaced. :) This is because you are changing the `namespaced_genrators_test` which are specifically for when you have an isolated engine.\n\nIn other words, we need to account for two scenarios:\n\n1) The scenario you posted in the bug description;\n\n2) The scenario you have a namespaced engine and you *don't* want the full namespace, because the router is already namespaced as a whole.\n\nTherefore I would suggest to add a new test to the scaffold/resource generator test case and ensure the current one keeps passing, specially because of this line:\n\nhttps://github.com/parndt/rails/blob/2fa841aa17d924610d963ad404d4af2b59e6de0a/railties/test/generators/namespaced_generators_test.rb#L10 \n\nAnd always send pull requests to the master branch. We can always backport it later.\n\nThanks!", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7931512", "created_at": "2012-08-22T11:37:52Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7414#issuecomment-7931512", "updated_at": "2012-08-22T11:38:04Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7414, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fbd3bd3543c15100b892"}, "id": 7931512, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7414"}
