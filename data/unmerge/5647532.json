{"body": "I'm also gonna give a :thumbsup: to @lawrencepit on this one. After reading the JSON spec closely I realised the string with the escaped solidus is equivalent, so escaping it is optional.\r\n\r\nTo express in Ruby\r\n```ruby\r\n{\"key\" => \"<script>something</script>\"}.to_json == {\"key\" => \"<script>something<\\/script>\"}.to_json\r\n```\r\nand also\r\n```ruby\r\nJSON.parse(\"{\\\"key\\\":\\\"<script>something</script>\\\"}\") == JSON.parse(\"{\\\"key\\\":\\\"<script>something<\\/script>\\\"}\")\r\n```\r\nboth producing\r\n```ruby\r\n{\"key\"=>\"<script>something</script>\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy issue was that I thought the suggestion was to make a real change to JSON encoding, in reality this is completely in-line with the JSON spec, implementing an optional extra, and makes putting JSON into the browser way more convenient.\r\n\r\nI still think we have a problem escaping JSON in Rails, but this is going to be convenient for a lot people and is easy innocuous change to make.\r\n\r\n@josevalim was your issue the same as mine?
