After reading the JSON spec closely I realised the string with the escaped solidus is equivalent, so escaping it is optional.\r\n\r\nTo express in Ruby\r\n```ruby\r\n{\"key\" => \"<script>something</script>\"}.to_json == {\"key\" => \"<script>something<\\/script>\"}.to_json\r\n```\r\nand also\r\n```ruby\r\nJSON.parse(\"{\\\"key\\\":\\\"<script>something</script>\\\"}\") == JSON.parse(\"{\\\"key\\\":\\\"<script>something<\\/script>\\\"}\")\r\n```\r\nboth producing\r\n```ruby\r\n{\"key\"=>\"<script>something</script>\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy issue was that I thought the suggestion was to make a real change to JSON encoding, in reality this is completely in-line with the JSON spec, implementing an optional extra, and makes putting JSON into the browser way more convenient.\r\n\r\nI still think we have a problem escaping JSON in Rails, but this is going to be convenient for a lot people and is easy innocuous change to make.\r\n\r\n@josevalim was your issue the same as mine? Maybe you will change your mind also?", "_id": {"$oid": "52383739bd3543c15100fe26"}, "issue_id": 3354, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5647532", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3354#issuecomment-5647532", "updated_at": "2012-05-11T10:01:02Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bestie/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bestie/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bestie/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bestie/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bestie", "login": "bestie", "gravatar_id": "9b6423e15df69eef44d5d34189e128f3", "html_url": "https://github.com/bestie", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bestie/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bestie/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bestie/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9b6423e15df69eef44d5d34189e128f3?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a315ec50af2ccf4ae9c185a87e87f4e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bestie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 145723, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bestie/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-11T10:01:02Z", "id": 5647532, "owner": "rails"}
