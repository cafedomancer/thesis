I totally agree with the problem you're describing, in that you end up having to rely on generators, which is contrary to the whole idea of \"mountable apps\"\r\n\r\nI feel like there needs to be a way or option to toggle engine specific concerns in the root namespace or in it's own namespace. When I need to extend, I wish they were namespaced, when I need to just plug-in, I don't want to generate all of the concerns.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c95bd3543c15100e502"}, "issue_id": 5120, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4670852", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5120#issuecomment-4670852", "updated_at": "2012-03-24T01:34:35Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpickett/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpickett/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpickett/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpickett/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpickett", "login": "dpickett", "gravatar_id": "ae619e02984c5efc3d3e6f9fef39079c", "html_url": "https://github.com/dpickett", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpickett/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpickett/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpickett/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ae619e02984c5efc3d3e6f9fef39079c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F818f4654ed39a1c147d1e51a00ffb4cb.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpickett/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1082, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dpickett/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-24T01:34:35Z", "id": 4670852, "owner": "rails"}
