In my case I was experimenting with a decorator around a scope. Part of what it added was information about the tables being joined against. So, the non-commutative aspect wasn't an issue. It was working fine until #4201 where it lost the joins_values information. I switched the method gathering the joins_values from a scope to a class method and that resolved the issue (class methods don't suffer from the unscope issue that was introduced).\r\n\r\nOutside of my particular case there might be some circumstance where you could provide multiple scopes that are aware of each other. I can't think of an example of this but that doesn't mean someone might not want to do it.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381e6bbd3543c15100e698"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4983#issuecomment-10696909"}
