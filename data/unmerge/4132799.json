The place where the typecast is performed is where the knowledge of \"is this value the same as the original one after the typecast or not?\" is contained. Also, I think it is not that trivial to implement, so I would appreciate any suggestions on how to approach this.\r\n\r\nWe would have to be able to somehow compare the following values, either one by one at write_attribute time, or at some other stage:\r\n\r\n    price = Price.find ...\r\n\r\n    price.price = 'foo'\r\n    price.attributes\r\n    price.attributes_before_type_cast\r\n\r\n    # => {\"id\"=>1, \"price\"=>0, \"product_id\"=>1, \"created_at\"=>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 17:22:26 UTC +00:00, \"updated_at\"=>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 17:22:26 UTC +00:00}\r\n    # => {\"id\"=>1, \"price\"=>\"foo\", \"product_id\"=>1, \"created_at\"=>\"2012-02-22 17:22:26.991756\", \"updated_at\"=>\"2012-02-22 17:22:26.991756\"}", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c66bd3543c15100e4ba"}, "issue_id": 5135, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4132799", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5135#issuecomment-4132799", "updated_at": "2012-02-23T08:55:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mitio/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mitio/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mitio/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mitio/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mitio", "login": "mitio", "gravatar_id": "90793237d18f9c12460d11a2db4ee277", "html_url": "https://github.com/mitio", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mitio/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mitio/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mitio/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/90793237d18f9c12460d11a2db4ee277?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F5e21c1e69368d1353258ccfad063bbfa.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mitio/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 129307, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mitio/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-02-23T08:55:27Z", "id": 4132799, "owner": "rails"}
