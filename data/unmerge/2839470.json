In any case, I think it's backwards, and `Hash[...]` is the only Ruby example I can think of that is similar (and I still hope to remedy to that!)", "_id": {"$oid": "523832b1bd3543c15100f8f9"}, "issue_id": 3716, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2839470", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3716#issuecomment-2839470", "updated_at": "2011-11-22T19:50:10Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre", "login": "marcandre", "gravatar_id": "b06d8e26b92456b228d3c77b66397534", "html_url": "https://github.com/marcandre", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b06d8e26b92456b228d3c77b66397534?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b48ea597d2862688e4aa8a2b28651a3.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 33770, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-22T19:50:10Z", "id": 2839470, "owner": "rails"}
