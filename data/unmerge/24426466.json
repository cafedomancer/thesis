If it's breaking stuff it definitely makes it more pressing :+1:\r\n\r\n@ersatzryan default to 3 instead of 0 according to the de facto standard set by browsers as @jamesotron in the other thread, so it's not arbitrary, the choices is clearly between 0 or 3 here.\r\n\r\nI think for the looking forward, 3 is a more reasonable default than 0, especially when it has the bonus points of being inline with what browsers do. Ultimately if there's way to change this, I don't think most people would mind it one way or the other.\r\n\r\nIt guess I don't object using global variables, seeing how that's what we do currently, just wanted to take this opportunity to brainstorm on the longer term fix here, but I guess it's not a blocker.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best thing to do is declare this 28ab79d a regression, revert it for 4.0.1, and add the config for 4.1 with a default of 3.\r\n\r\n@jeremy?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cdbabd3543c1510079c2"}, "issue_id": 12226, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/24426466", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12226#issuecomment-24426466", "updated_at": "2013-09-13T21:38:21Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode", "login": "chancancode", "gravatar_id": "22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a", "html_url": "https://github.com/chancancode", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b407b57d02a2e41c7ba54441391d9ce.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 55829, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-09-13T21:38:21Z", "id": 24426466, "owner": "rails"}
