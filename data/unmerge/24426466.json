If it's breaking stuff it definitely makes it more pressing :+1:\r\n\r\n@ersatzryan default to 3 instead of 0 according to the de facto standard set by browsers as @jamesotron in the other thread, so it's not arbitrary, the choices is clearly between 0 or 3 here.\r\n\r\nI think for the looking forward, 3 is a more reasonable default than 0, especially when it has the bonus points of being inline with what browsers do. Ultimately if there's way to change this, I don't think most people would mind it one way or the other.\r\n\r\nIt guess I don't object using global variables, seeing how that's what we do currently, just wanted to take this opportunity to brainstorm on the longer term fix here, but I guess it's not a blocker.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best thing to do is declare this 28ab79d a regression, revert it for 4.0.1, and add the config for 4.1 with a default of 3.\r\n\r\n@jeremy?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cdbabd3543c1510079c2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12226#issuecomment-24426466"}
