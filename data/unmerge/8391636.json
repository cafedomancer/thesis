{"body": "@tenderlove this is only a prove of concept and the code is not ready to be merged. I wanted to put the code here though to have a place for an open discussion. I also got some questions before I can finish the code:\n* should postgres timestamps be mapped as timestamps or datetimes?\n* can both timestamp and datetime be used for time-zone data?\n* if there is a sql-data type, which is not recognized, how should I issue a warning? print to the stderr? I think you can have a table with a not supported datatype, as long as you don't access the field you should be fine. Should the warning be issued on access or when the column is created?\n\nthanks for the inputs and the feedback.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8391636", "created_at": "2012-09-08T17:14:32Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7575#issuecomment-8391636", "updated_at": "2012-09-08T17:14:32Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7575, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "senny", "type": "User", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ddd5ebd354364b900ae37"}, "id": 8391636, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7575"}
