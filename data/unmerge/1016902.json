{"body": "@dhh\r\n\r\nThe purpose of making the password hash algorithm slow is to make it extremely difficult for an attacker to perform an offline dictionary attack against one stolen password hash, let alone against a whole database of them. As the attackers' computers become faster or as the attacker is able to gain access to more of them, retaining the same level of protection requires that we raise the cost of the password hash algorithm. If the attacker's capacity to perform an offline dictionary attack doubles in two years, then websites should double the cost of the password hash algorithm every two years.\r\n\r\nSee the very existence of PBKDF2 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2): \"The added computational work makes password cracking much more difficult, and is known as key stretching. When the standard was written in 2000, the recommended minimum number of iterations was 1000, but the parameter is intended to be increased over time as CPU speeds increase.\" The same principle applies whether one uses bcrypt, scrypt, pbkdf2, or iterated hmac.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1016902", "created_at": "2011-04-17T14:59:34Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/285#issuecomment-1016902", "updated_at": "2011-04-17T14:59:34Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 285, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/yfeldblum", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5eadf00e11240f05263ec7735612cd09?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F485970c473e9165d1649e16c7aa35b83.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/received_events", "gravatar_id": "5eadf00e11240f05263ec7735612cd09", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "yfeldblum", "type": "User", "id": 169419, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238635abd3543c1510124af"}, "id": 1016902, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/285"}
