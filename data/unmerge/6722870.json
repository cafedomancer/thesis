Using `reset_counters` is good for a particular `id` as you said, to ensure the counter is up-to-date, and to reset (to zero) a collection of records it seems easier to assume `update_all`.\n\nThanks for your contribution :)", "_id": {"$oid": "523801c0bd3543c15100c1d1"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6937#issuecomment-6722870"}
