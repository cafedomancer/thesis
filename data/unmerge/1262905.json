Now, call a coffee-script from the js.erb-template ...\n\n  6. index.js.erb => `call_coffee();`\n  7. assets/javascript/test_controller.js.coffee => `@call_coffe = () -> alert(\"Hello from coffee\")`\n\nNow, if `:layout => false` is not explicitly given ...\n\n    _include_layout?(options)\n    LOG options => {:prefixes=>[\"test_controller\", \"application\"], :template=>\"index\", **:layout=>\"layouts/application\"**, :stream=>nil}\n\nwith my 'workaround' or :layout => false everything works as expected.\nI'm kinda confused but hopefully this info will help.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52385813bd3543c151011bec"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1393#issuecomment-1262905"}
