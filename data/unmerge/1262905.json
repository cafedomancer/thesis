Here my experience ... \n\n  1. `rails new dummy`\n  2. `rails g controller TestController index`\n  3. adding `gem haml` and  route `root :to => 'test_controller#index'`\n  4. index.haml => `link_to 'test', root_path, :remote => true`\n  5. index.js.erb => `alert(\"Hello from js.erb\");`\n\nSo far things are fine. Now, call a coffee-script from the js.erb-template ...\n\n  6. index.js.erb => `call_coffee();`\n  7. assets/javascript/test_controller.js.coffee => `@call_coffe = () -> alert(\"Hello from coffee\")`\n\nNow, if `:layout => false` is not explicitly given ...\n\n    _include_layout?(options)\n    LOG options => {:prefixes=>[\"test_controller\", \"application\"], :template=>\"index\", **:layout=>\"layouts/application\"**, :stream=>nil}\n\nwith my 'workaround' or :layout => false everything works as expected.\nI'm kinda confused but hopefully this info will help.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52385813bd3543c151011bec"}, "issue_id": 1393, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1262905", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1393#issuecomment-1262905", "updated_at": "2011-05-30T18:57:35Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iboard/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iboard/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iboard/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iboard/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/iboard", "login": "iboard", "gravatar_id": "b8a2e0c01730184ff23c5f09a55933f9", "html_url": "https://github.com/iboard", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iboard/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iboard/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iboard/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b8a2e0c01730184ff23c5f09a55933f9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc77704219ca3bd62e309f297b3c39fd9.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iboard/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 12751, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iboard/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-30T18:48:03Z", "id": 1262905, "owner": "rails"}
