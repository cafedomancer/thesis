Declaring a parent object invalid depending on a `has_many` relationship is backward. An object should only validate its own attributes. This validation doesn't make sense because if someone deletes the `bird` directly, the `pirate` remains invalid, which can cause issues later on since that object (although invalid) remains in the database. This kind of behavior is best implemented in a `before_save` callback, and on a case-by-case basis, IMO.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381885bd3543c15100e064"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5413#issuecomment-4485572"}
