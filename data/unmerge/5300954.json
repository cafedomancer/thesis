{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5907", "repo": "rails", "body": "While I think the suggested solution (i.e. the change to Mocha) is the best pragmatic option, philosophically I think it implies that Mocha should not rely on any other core Ruby methods in classes like `Class`, `Object` or `Kernel` and therefore ought to alias all of these as well which seems a bit crazy.\r\n\r\nIt's not impossible that other libraries or applications may also expect `Object#method` to have it's original implementation and may be surprised by Rails' redefinition. Perhaps a better longer term solution is for Ruby itself to alias `Object#method` as `Object#__method__` like it does for `Object#send`, given that `#method` is so generic it's very likely to be used in other situations.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll attend to the Mocha pull request and release a new version.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238117fbd3543c15100d80a"}, "issue_id": 5907, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5300954", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5907#issuecomment-5300954", "updated_at": "2012-04-24T09:44:14Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper", "login": "floehopper", "gravatar_id": "f1c2a5fff725fde524bb84503528bd1e", "html_url": "https://github.com/floehopper", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f1c2a5fff725fde524bb84503528bd1e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7a98af17e63a0ac09ce2e96d03992fbc.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3169, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/floehopper/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-24T09:44:14Z", "id": 5300954, "owner": "rails"}
