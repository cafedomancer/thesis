Perhaps a better longer term solution is for Ruby itself to alias `Object#method` as `Object#__method__` like it does for `Object#send`, given that `#method` is so generic it's very likely to be used in other situations.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll attend to the Mocha pull request and release a new version.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238117fbd3543c15100d80a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5907#issuecomment-5300954"}
