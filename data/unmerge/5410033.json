{"body": "I don't really buy the \"grouping\" argument, as people can make multiple calls to `delegate` and your grouping goes out the window.  For example, this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndelegate {:supervisor => :name, :address => :street}, :to => :person\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould have the same behavior as this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndelegate {:supervisor => :name}, :to => :person\r\n\r\n# many many lines removed\r\n\r\ndelegate {:address => :street}, :to => :person\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo grouping is lost.  That means you'd have to stick to the convention of making sure all delegates to the same object are grouped together.  And if you're going to make a convention about grouping, why not just group together some methods?  \r\n\r\nSince this is my line of thinking, I don't find the feature very useful.  But like I said, I don't really care if we add this or not.  It seems harmless (besides the harm of acquiring more technical debt), but I'll never use it.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5410033", "created_at": "2012-04-30T00:04:37Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3069#issuecomment-5410033", "updated_at": "2012-04-30T00:04:37Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3069, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tenderlove", "type": "User", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383b01bd3543c15101024f"}, "id": 5410033, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3069"}
