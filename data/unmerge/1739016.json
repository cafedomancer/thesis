However the preference of :reject_unless and :reject_if is rather a matter of taste (for example, in would prefer to use :reject_if in the cases you showed above). Nonetheless, :reject_unless feels like a double negation, I believe :accept_if would be a much better option.\r\n\r\nIn any case, regardless of using :accept_if or :reject_unless, I feel like this patch would just add more code and complexity without an explicit benefit.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384384bd3543c151010c41"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2441#issuecomment-1739016"}
