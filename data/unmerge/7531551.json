{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7263", "repo": "rails", "body": "@Fxn, I see what you mean, but what happens when you mix tabs and spaces, is not undefined (correct me if I am wrong). strip_heredoc determines how many tabs and/or spaces there are on the first line; let's say it's two spaces and a tab. Then it will delete the first three tabs and/or spaces from each line. I will leave other spaces and/or tabs after the first three tabs and/or spaces alone. \n\nI propose not to find out what the first character of the first line is; instead default to space, and if the extra parameter is there, then use that.\n\nWhat do you think, should strip_heredoc be limited to spaces and tabs? Because if that's the case, then tabs=false should be the default extra parameter. Like this: strip_heredoc(2,true) for adding two tabs to the beginning of the stripped text (irregardless if the heredoc has tabs, space or mixed tabs and spaces).\n\n?\n\n\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fdc7bd3543c15100bbab"}, "issue_id": 7263, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7531551", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7263#issuecomment-7531551", "updated_at": "2012-08-06T18:33:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares", "login": "acesuares", "gravatar_id": "3dfc4136712f120023f092004f062cc4", "html_url": "https://github.com/acesuares", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dfc4136712f120023f092004f062cc4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Faeefb050911334869a7a5d9e4d0e1689.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2784, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-06T18:33:42Z", "id": 7531551, "owner": "rails"}
