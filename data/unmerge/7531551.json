Then it will delete the first three tabs and/or spaces from each line. I will leave other spaces and/or tabs after the first three tabs and/or spaces alone. \n\nI propose not to find out what the first character of the first line is; instead default to space, and if the extra parameter is there, then use that.\n\nWhat do you think, should strip_heredoc be limited to spaces and tabs? Because if that's the case, then tabs=false should be the default extra parameter. Like this: strip_heredoc(2,true) for adding two tabs to the beginning of the stripped text (irregardless if the heredoc has tabs, space or mixed tabs and spaces).\n\n?\n\n\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fdc7bd3543c15100bbab"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7263#issuecomment-7531551"}
