It was turned down for a few pretty good reasons, one of them being the extensions to Symbol being considered poor form. I could be remembering wrong, but I seem to recall @dkubb saying that datamapper 2.0 was moving away from Symbol extensions as well. So it would seem that this would be heading in the wrong direction.
