Basically, it does what it used to do before (attempts a single execute to disable ALL triggers on all tables), but will fallback to trying a single execute to disable all USER triggers if cannot disable ALL triggers, and will re-enable USER if fails to re-enable ALL. This may not be as complete as the previous patch, but is more backwards-compatible by only attempting to execute one for disable and once for re-enable, so length of tests for those using database_cleaner, etc. should be the same instead of taking more time.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f2abbd3543c15100a699"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8498#issuecomment-11442479"}
