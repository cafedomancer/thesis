{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8498", "repo": "rails", "body": "Simplified patch. Basically, it does what it used to do before (attempts a single execute to disable ALL triggers on all tables), but will fallback to trying a single execute to disable all USER triggers if cannot disable ALL triggers, and will re-enable USER if fails to re-enable ALL. This may not be as complete as the previous patch, but is more backwards-compatible by only attempting to execute one for disable and once for re-enable, so length of tests for those using database_cleaner, etc. should be the same instead of taking more time.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f2abbd3543c15100a699"}, "issue_id": 8498, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11442479", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8498#issuecomment-11442479", "updated_at": "2012-12-17T14:01:47Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver", "login": "garysweaver", "gravatar_id": "8838005371ab9c0b1d40f0504bf8832a", "html_url": "https://github.com/garysweaver", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/8838005371ab9c0b1d40f0504bf8832a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4eb6720c6cd70ee9e67ca6e4dc12e3df.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 92330, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-17T14:01:47Z", "id": 11442479, "owner": "rails"}
