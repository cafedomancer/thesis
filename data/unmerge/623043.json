{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/137", "repo": "rails", "body": "Hey, thanks for the pull request. However, I am not quite comfortable with this approach. Using .extend in runtime is slow (as it busts Ruby's method cache) and the patch also introduces a new API that is quite similar to AS::Callbacks.\r\n\r\nThe best way to solve the first problem is to have a callbacks system in the response, something like response.close_callback { }, and the block would be called once close! is invoked. Then the current AD::Callback middleware would simply do something like:\r\n\r\n    if response.respond_to?(:close) && response.respond_to?(:close_callback)\r\n      response.close_callback { _run_after_callbacks }\r\n    else\r\n      _run_after_callbacks\r\n    end\r\n\r\nBut we would need to break _run_call_callbacks in AD::Callback in two. The only problem with this approach, afaik, is that it is non deterministic when stuff gets unloaded. Maybe we could use a proxy to wrap objects that do not respond to close! and ensure it gets called in all cases. Not sure of the performance hit as well though.", "_id": {"$oid": "523868afbd3543c1510129b8"}, "issue_id": 137, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/623043", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/137#issuecomment-623043", "updated_at": "2010-12-19T21:00:34Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2010-12-19T21:00:34Z", "id": 623043, "owner": "rails"}
