You wrote this, so you probably have better insight as to whether this is desired functionality or not.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we had ``available_queries_for_explain = []``, then whenever you called the ``finish`` function, you would never add anything to the list of ``available_queries_for_explain``. I don't think that is desired behavior, and I believe that checking for nil in that file was just trying to assure that ``queries`` was an array, though I'm not sure.", "_id": {"$oid": "523cf0b6bd354364b900354e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10198#issuecomment-16334547"}
