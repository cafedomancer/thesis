My thoughts about the benefits of extracting it as a gem are [also above](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11148#issuecomment-20191610), but basically \r\n\r\n1. There is a demonstrated desire for the gem as evidenced by forks of it popping up periodically\r\n2. Statistics code really doesn't need to be tied to the Rails release cycle\r\n3. Statistics LOC / code profiling aren't really a fundamental part of the Rails stack.\r\n4. It's a common pattern for Rails to spawn dependent gems that don't themselves require Rails, or that aren't a fundamental part of the stack.\r\n5. The code would be much better maintained on its own.  There's been some code rot around this functionality.\r\n\r\n@dhh actually commented above [that he'd prefer to keep existing functionality intact](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11148#issuecomment-20754056) (at least per my understanding).\r\n\r\n[related post on rubyonrails-core](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-core/yVMreNOn2jQ/fCETsMyemn0J) if that is helpful for discussion.", "_id": {"$oid": "523c9922bd354364b90018a7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11148#issuecomment-24194514"}
