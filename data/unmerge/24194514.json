{"body": "Thanks for your thoughts @josevalim.  My thoughts about the benefits of extracting it as a gem are [also above](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11148#issuecomment-20191610), but basically \r\n\r\n1. There is a demonstrated desire for the gem as evidenced by forks of it popping up periodically\r\n2. Statistics code really doesn't need to be tied to the Rails release cycle\r\n3. Statistics LOC / code profiling aren't really a fundamental part of the Rails stack.\r\n4. It's a common pattern for Rails to spawn dependent gems that don't themselves require Rails, or that aren't a fundamental part of the stack.\r\n5. The code would be much better maintained on its own.  There's been some code rot around this functionality.\r\n\r\n@dhh actually commented above [that he'd prefer to keep existing functionality intact](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11148#issuecomment-20754056) (at least per my understanding).\r\n\r\n[related post on rubyonrails-core](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-core/yVMreNOn2jQ/fCETsMyemn0J) if that is helpful for discussion.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/24194514", "created_at": "2013-09-10T21:05:25Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11148#issuecomment-24194514", "updated_at": "2013-09-10T21:05:25Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 11148, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/bf4", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/a4e890117ae8877a5c86d5710bfcd594?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc14ca2c02996c1f0dcd65fbbf0142c02.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/received_events", "gravatar_id": "a4e890117ae8877a5c86d5710bfcd594", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "bf4", "type": "User", "id": 142914, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bf4/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523c9922bd354364b90018a7"}, "id": 24194514, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11148"}
