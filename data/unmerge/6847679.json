I think an option that looks more natural to me would be a hyphen:\n\n    \"Foo::Bar_Baz\" <=> \"foo/bar-baz\"\n\nNowadays \"bar-baz\" is camelized as \"Bar-baz\", therefore nobody is using that as a file or directory name and would be backwards compatible given the fact that camelize and underscore are meant to solve this problem. (Of course any solution would be backwards incompatible if we take them as mere functions on strings, but they are not.)\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380dbabd3543c15100d322"}, "issue_id": 6105, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6847679", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6105#issuecomment-6847679", "updated_at": "2012-07-09T14:20:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-09T14:20:04Z", "id": 6847679, "owner": "rails"}
