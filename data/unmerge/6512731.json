Also, non RDBMS have a different memory allocation scheme.\n\nIt would be great if we could have a low-level control about our threads and/or processes. For instance, use rules like:\n\n  - All database-dependent requests should share those 6 threads/processes.\n  - All long-running report requests should share another 3 threads/processes.\n  - Third-party API consumers should use another pool of threads/processes.\n  - ...\n\nThat would be really awesome, but I guess currently we'd need something like a load balancing proxy for distributing requests like this... :( And that means that different processes would be required which prevent one from sharing in-memory state among those processes unless they use something like memcached.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c73f"}, "issue_id": 6685, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6512731", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6512731", "updated_at": "2012-06-22T16:56:16Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld", "login": "rosenfeld", "gravatar_id": "2abdb50caf0dc5b510330f68b02db8e4", "html_url": "https://github.com/rosenfeld", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2abdb50caf0dc5b510330f68b02db8e4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c3aa93f86af77d8b1071d5fd2b4c91a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 32246, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-22T16:55:46Z", "id": 6512731, "owner": "rails"}
