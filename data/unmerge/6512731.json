Also, non RDBMS have a different memory allocation scheme.\n\nIt would be great if we could have a low-level control about our threads and/or processes. For instance, use rules like:\n\n  - All database-dependent requests should share those 6 threads/processes.\n  - All long-running report requests should share another 3 threads/processes.\n  - Third-party API consumers should use another pool of threads/processes.\n  - ...\n\nThat would be really awesome, but I guess currently we'd need something like a load balancing proxy for distributing requests like this... :( And that means that different processes would be required which prevent one from sharing in-memory state among those processes unless they use something like memcached.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c73f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6512731"}
