{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2890", "repo": "rails", "body": "Yeah, I've seen that change where they used constants. I don't know which was the decision at that time, but I'll find out :).\r\n\r\nUsing `config.i18n.fallbacks` was a possible solution for those currently facing the issue. I agree number helpers shouldn't raise exceptions. My idea was having the framework to fallback to :en locale config instead of using constants - because we can be sure that the framework has such configs in its locale file, instead of the possible duplicated constant.
