{"body": "Thanks for checking it out, Jos\u00e9.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I follow how a class-level to_model resolves the problem this patch was intended to address -- that is, the desire to allow instance-specific details to influence certain attributes of the ActiveModel::Name, as in http://github.com/ernie/meta_search/blob/arel-2.0/lib/meta_search/model_compatibility.rb#L38 or the included test.\r\n\r\nThat being said, while I clearly have a use case for something like this, if it's not really something that many others might get some use out of, I can find a different workaround in my code. It just seems like it would add extra utility to FormBuilder, etc to allow an instance to have some influence over the routes that get generated for it.\r\n\r\nAs for additional ORM support, not at this time. I make use of AR's JoinDependency to do some of the heavy lifting in Builder, so I haven't gone through the pain of a refactor, in the absence of actual requests for DM support, etc.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/446419", "created_at": "2010-10-04T14:33:11Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/66#issuecomment-446419", "updated_at": "2010-10-04T14:33:11Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 66, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/ernie", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6a600c968f4e6a843dcaf600c1694e42.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "ernie", "type": "User", "id": 14947, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386ca9bd3543c151012cdb"}, "id": 446419, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/66"}
