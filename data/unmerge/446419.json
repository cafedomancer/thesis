It just seems like it would add extra utility to FormBuilder, etc to allow an instance to have some influence over the routes that get generated for it.\r\n\r\nAs for additional ORM support, not at this time. I make use of AR's JoinDependency to do some of the heavy lifting in Builder, so I haven't gone through the pain of a refactor, in the absence of actual requests for DM support, etc.", "_id": {"$oid": "52386ca9bd3543c151012cdb"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/66#issuecomment-446419"}
