The tests just happen to have the same setup but the actual code they are testing does not rely on that setup. Hence I don't think we should generalize and make the tests harder to read and reason about. In my opinion this refactoring does not help the expressiveness of the tests and does not make them less brittle or easier maintainable.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e835bd3543c1510096a9"}, "issue_id": 9583, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14496744", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9583#issuecomment-14496744", "updated_at": "2013-03-06T12:26:26Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "login": "senny", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-06T12:26:26Z", "id": 14496744, "owner": "rails"}
