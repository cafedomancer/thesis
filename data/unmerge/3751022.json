The `%e`, according to `ri strftime` is blank-padded:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      %d - Day of the month, zero-padded (01..31)\r\n              %-d  no-padded (1..31)\r\n      %e - Day of the month, blank-padded ( 1..31)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich gives me these results by default in Rails 3.1.3:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(rdb:1) d=Time.now.tomorrow.to_date\r\nWed, 01 Feb 2012\r\n\r\n(rdb:1) d.to_s(:long)\r\n\"February  1, 2012\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use \"%-d\" for the day in your format string:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(rdb:1) Date::DATE_FORMATS[:long] = \"%B %-d, %Y\"\r\n\"%B %-d, %Y\"\r\n\r\n(rdb:1) d.to_s(:long)\r\n\"February 1, 2012\"\r\n```\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52384b2bbd3543c15101137e"}, "issue_id": 1994, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3751022", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1994#issuecomment-3751022", "updated_at": "2012-02-01T00:08:38Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TylerRick/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TylerRick/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TylerRick/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TylerRick/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TylerRick", "login": "TylerRick", "gravatar_id": "93e3e0fd88c1b97faebfe248c51017d3", "html_url": "https://github.com/TylerRick", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TylerRick/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TylerRick/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TylerRick/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/93e3e0fd88c1b97faebfe248c51017d3?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fee2689a415fc2b28bb05fb5e195ebf04.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TylerRick/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 14151, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TylerRick/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-02-01T00:08:22Z", "id": 3751022, "owner": "rails"}
