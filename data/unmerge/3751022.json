The `%e`, according to `ri strftime` is blank-padded:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      %d - Day of the month, zero-padded (01..31)\r\n              %-d  no-padded (1..31)\r\n      %e - Day of the month, blank-padded ( 1..31)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich gives me these results by default in Rails 3.1.3:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(rdb:1) d=Time.now.tomorrow.to_date\r\nWed, 01 Feb 2012\r\n\r\n(rdb:1) d.to_s(:long)\r\n\"February  1, 2012\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use \"%-d\" for the day in your format string:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(rdb:1) Date::DATE_FORMATS[:long] = \"%B %-d, %Y\"\r\n\"%B %-d, %Y\"\r\n\r\n(rdb:1) d.to_s(:long)\r\n\"February 1, 2012\"\r\n```\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52384b2bbd3543c15101137e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1994#issuecomment-3751022"}
