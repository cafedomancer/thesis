Log messages are typically delimited by newlines.. and can also contain newlines, unfortunately. You'll notice that other logs contain prefixes, like timestamps and program names, that aren't repeated after every newline, just at the beginning of the *log message*. If you use another logger, like syslog, you'll see that newlines may be stripped or escaped, resulting in a single coherent message.\r\n\r\nTo approximate this behavior when you're logging to a file, your best bet is to override the Logger's formatter and have it strip newlines out.", "_id": {"$oid": "52428c3abd354335e700008b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12340#issuecomment-25052752"}
