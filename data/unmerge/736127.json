I have another proposal to fix the issue though, what if we just overwrite this method inside SecurePassword: https://github.com/kuroda/rails/blob/f126895d58134476435a8aa6e5f1f0ba13ca341a/activemodel/lib/active_model/mass_assignment_security.rb#L145-147\r\n\r\nThe following will do the trick:\r\n\r\n    def attributes_protected_by_default\r\n      super + [:password_digest]\r\n    end\r\n\r\nAnd we would have the same result without checking for authorizers. This is the same API used by ActiveRecord to set defaults, so it is safe to use.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238668ebd3543c1510127fb"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/172#issuecomment-736127"}
