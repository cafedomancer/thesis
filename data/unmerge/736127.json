{"body": "Kuroda thanks for your pull request with nice tests! I have another proposal to fix the issue though, what if we just overwrite this method inside SecurePassword: https://github.com/kuroda/rails/blob/f126895d58134476435a8aa6e5f1f0ba13ca341a/activemodel/lib/active_model/mass_assignment_security.rb#L145-147\r\n\r\nThe following will do the trick:\r\n\r\n    def attributes_protected_by_default\r\n      super + [:password_digest]\r\n    end\r\n\r\nAnd we would have the same result without checking for authorizers. This is the same API used by ActiveRecord to set defaults, so it is safe to use.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/736127", "created_at": "2011-02-03T15:46:47Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/172#issuecomment-736127", "updated_at": "2011-02-03T15:46:47Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 172, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238668ebd3543c1510127fb"}, "id": 736127, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/172"}
