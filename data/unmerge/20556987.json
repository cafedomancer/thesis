I've tried cloning directly from rails/rails to my machine, and then cannot open a pull request. Your tutorial shows how to squash, but the steps on how to update an existing pull request are unclear and didn't work for me. So I've just created yet another pull request, for what should be a good 'final' version of that file. You may want to add something to it later, but for now it is much better than what is currently live. Thanks.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d625bd3543c151008287"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11326#issuecomment-20556987"}
