{"body": "@jarl-dk Thanks for the clarification about `:prefix`.\r\n\r\nAs another commit in this pull-request, since you're already working on this code, perhaps you can add a make the real option in rails-4 be `:units` but also make `:prefix` be a synonym of `:units` for backward compatibility?\r\n\r\nAlso I would go back to using `:binary` instead of `:customary` since \"binary prefix\" is [actually the name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix) of the customary units of measurement.\r\n\r\n(In this case the word \"prefix\" does not describe the units with relation to the number, but only describes the order-of-magnitude part of the units (e.g., `mega`) with relation to the dimension (e.g., `bytes`).)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9122869", "created_at": "2012-10-03T21:26:00Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7835#issuecomment-9122869", "updated_at": "2012-10-03T21:26:00Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7835, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/yfeldblum", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5eadf00e11240f05263ec7735612cd09?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F485970c473e9165d1649e16c7aa35b83.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/received_events", "gravatar_id": "5eadf00e11240f05263ec7735612cd09", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "yfeldblum", "type": "User", "id": 169419, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f878bd3543c15100b2a0"}, "id": 9122869, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7835"}
