There's a credit transaction log that shows these additions and substractions, like this:\n\n     +100 credits --- initial setup\n       -1 credit  --- a single action\n      -25 credits --- a big action\n    +1000 credits --- recharged\n\nAnother possible scenario would be a twitter-like text area where you've got a count of the remaining characters. If you show the word and not just number, it should go like...\n\n    140 characters\n     25 characters\n      0 characters\n     -1 character\n     -2 characters\n    -30 characters\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523806d1bd3543c15100c9c6"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6533#issuecomment-6037673"}
