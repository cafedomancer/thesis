{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6533", "repo": "rails", "body": "Here's the real scenario that motivated this change: I've got an app where users have credits, that they can spend and recharge. There's a credit transaction log that shows these additions and substractions, like this:\n\n     +100 credits --- initial setup\n       -1 credit  --- a single action\n      -25 credits --- a big action\n    +1000 credits --- recharged\n\nAnother possible scenario would be a twitter-like text area where you've got a count of the remaining characters. If you show the word and not just number, it should go like...\n\n    140 characters\n     25 characters\n      0 characters\n     -1 character\n     -2 characters\n    -30 characters\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523806d1bd3543c15100c9c6"}, "issue_id": 6533, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6037673", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6533#issuecomment-6037673", "updated_at": "2012-05-31T14:43:01Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaimeiniesta/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaimeiniesta/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaimeiniesta/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaimeiniesta/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaimeiniesta", "login": "jaimeiniesta", "gravatar_id": "0e6c0ba9935b52866fd5c54dd886cf2e", "html_url": "https://github.com/jaimeiniesta", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaimeiniesta/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaimeiniesta/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaimeiniesta/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/0e6c0ba9935b52866fd5c54dd886cf2e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8cff9bf6694dccfc3b6a613d05d51d16.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaimeiniesta/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2629, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jaimeiniesta/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-31T14:43:01Z", "id": 6037673, "owner": "rails"}
