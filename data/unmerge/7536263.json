In theory it could erase the hard disk of the user. It won't, and sure will do _something_ and be deterministic, but the method does not commit to anything.\n\nThe contract is:\n\n* If the string uses spaces, the method does what you'd expect by default.\n\n* If the string uses tabs, the method does what you'd expect by default.\n\n* If the string uses tabs and spaces mixed: this input is unsupported, undefined behavior.\n\nWith respect to the char to indent, having a flag as third argument is a good idea. It would be a three-valued flag, though, which is a little unusual. We would need to understand \"guess it (default)\" (`nil`), from \"use spaces\" (`false`), and \"use tabs\" (`true`). Not 100% sure I like that interface, I like flags to be interpreted as per the Ruby definition of true and false.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fdc7bd3543c15100bbac"}, "issue_id": 7263, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7536263", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7263#issuecomment-7536263", "updated_at": "2012-08-06T21:04:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-06T21:04:37Z", "id": 7536263, "owner": "rails"}
