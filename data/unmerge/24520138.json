That's what will make things explicit.\r\n\r\nAnyway it was really nice discussion.\r\nThank you too.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cdb2bd3543c1510079b9"}, "issue_id": 12236, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/24520138", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12236#issuecomment-24520138", "updated_at": "2013-09-16T15:45:24Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/georgiev/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/georgiev/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/georgiev/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/georgiev/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/georgiev", "login": "georgiev", "gravatar_id": "2b04479fb847d7177977ac759769ce34", "html_url": "https://github.com/georgiev", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/georgiev/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/georgiev/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/georgiev/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2b04479fb847d7177977ac759769ce34?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F96a1a91bb8696aeb42b9a43aa9a4704f.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/georgiev/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 177977, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/georgiev/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-09-16T15:45:24Z", "id": 24520138, "owner": "rails"}
