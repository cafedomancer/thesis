The initial implementation was focused on `from` because IMHO this is the most popular usecase (according to my experiences). However afer @josevalim remarks I changed it so that more headers can be set, not only `from`. I am not 100% sure but I think this is also useful when you want custom default header in every email like `X-RailsIsAwesome`.\n\nAnd finally let me remind you that this implementation is basically 1-liner now: https://github.com/paneq/rails/commit/dd1b6f679af1c6e6ea8af655860ac0c96627a028#L0R416\n\nAnd I think it makes sense to have this so that `config/application.rb` can be coherent:\n\n```ruby\nconfig.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => \"example.org\", :protocol => \"https\" }\nconfig.action_mailer.default_options = {:from => \"newsletter@example.org\"}\n```\n\ninstead of\n\n```ruby\nconfig.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => \"example.org\", :protocol => \"https\" }\nActionMailer::Base.default_options = {:from => \"newsletter@example.org\"}\n```\n\nLast word: Nobody is forcing you to use this feature. I you prefer to inherit from `ApplicationMailer`, that's ok. I just think that some people would like to do it they way I presented and to allow it we just need 1 line of code. I think it is fair price for this \"feature\".", "_id": {"$oid": "5238049bbd3543c15100c5fd"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6747#issuecomment-6371725"}
