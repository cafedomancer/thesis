{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6747", "repo": "rails", "body": "@erichmenge - I see your point\n\n@rafaelfranca - This is not only useful for `from`, but also for things like `replay_to` or `return_path`. The initial implementation was focused on `from` because IMHO this is the most popular usecase (according to my experiences). However afer @josevalim remarks I changed it so that more headers can be set, not only `from`. I am not 100% sure but I think this is also useful when you want custom default header in every email like `X-RailsIsAwesome`.\n\nAnd finally let me remind you that this implementation is basically 1-liner now: https://github.com/paneq/rails/commit/dd1b6f679af1c6e6ea8af655860ac0c96627a028#L0R416\n\nAnd I think it makes sense to have this so that `config/application.rb` can be coherent:\n\n```ruby\nconfig.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => \"example.org\", :protocol => \"https\" }\nconfig.action_mailer.default_options = {:from => \"newsletter@example.org\"}\n```\n\ninstead of\n\n```ruby\nconfig.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => \"example.org\", :protocol => \"https\" }\nActionMailer::Base.default_options = {:from => \"newsletter@example.org\"}\n```\n\nLast word: Nobody is forcing you to use this feature. I you prefer to inherit from `ApplicationMailer`, that's ok. I just think that some people would like to do it they way I presented and to allow it we just need 1 line of code. I think it is fair price for this \"feature\".", "_id": {"$oid": "5238049bbd3543c15100c5fd"}, "issue_id": 6747, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6371725", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6747#issuecomment-6371725", "updated_at": "2012-06-16T08:39:40Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq", "login": "paneq", "gravatar_id": "9b81cae1fb43808ac23a2188258ca9e4", "html_url": "https://github.com/paneq", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/9b81cae1fb43808ac23a2188258ca9e4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F180bb054f1a36e1777b05a0664a7eb71.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 65587, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-16T08:39:40Z", "id": 6371725, "owner": "rails"}
