{"body": "So this allows you to do a global override of `foreign_key` for associations, etc. I can see how this could be useful with legacy schemas but as it currently stands the PR can't be accepted because it has no tests, no documentation and no CHANGELOG entry. Also I have doubts that the implementation is complete - for example if the model is the other end of a HABTM association you'd want to be the default for `:association_foreign_key` to be the value for `foreign_key` in the model.
