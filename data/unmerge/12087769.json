Also I have doubts that the implementation is complete - for example if the model is the other end of a HABTM association you'd want to be the default for `:association_foreign_key` to be the value for `foreign_key` in the model. There's also how this affects `model_name` as well which isn't really used within AR but is used mainly in AP and i18n.\r\n\r\n@rafaelfranca @carlosantoniodasilva @jonleighton wdyt of the concept?\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ef2dbd3543c15100a0df"}, "issue_id": 8867, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12087769", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8867#issuecomment-12087769", "updated_at": "2013-01-10T10:02:02Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-10T10:02:02Z", "id": 12087769, "owner": "rails"}
