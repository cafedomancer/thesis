{"body": "After reading @tenderlove's post once again, I think that `allow_concurrency` is the one which should be removed completely. That's the responsibility of servers, not Rails. So removing `allow_concurrency` (`Rack::Lock`, that is) from `threadsafe!` bundle seems sufficient to me, no?\n\n`preload_frameworks`, `cache_classes` and `dependency_loading` are all useful, so we could continue to bundle those three with `threadsafe!`. And `threadsafe!` should be enabled by default for production, as this ticket suggests.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6510387", "created_at": "2012-06-22T15:24:44Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6510387", "updated_at": "2012-06-22T16:49:49Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6685, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/kenn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f3c42aa7989a9a0c37709abc08a6327f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F20d749bc05f47d2bd3026ce457dcfd8e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f3c42aa7989a9a0c37709abc08a6327f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "kenn", "type": "User", "id": 10350, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c73a"}, "id": 6510387, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6685"}
