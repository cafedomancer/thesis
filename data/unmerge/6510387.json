That's the responsibility of servers, not Rails. So removing `allow_concurrency` (`Rack::Lock`, that is) from `threadsafe!` bundle seems sufficient to me, no?\n\n`preload_frameworks`, `cache_classes` and `dependency_loading` are all useful, so we could continue to bundle those three with `threadsafe!`. And `threadsafe!` should be enabled by default for production, as this ticket suggests.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c73a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6510387"}
