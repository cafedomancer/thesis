While I don't like having the word index twice (IndexDefinition#index_type), it is more rails friendly than overriding Object#method.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the create index code currently uses an index_type variable to specify unique. IndexDefinition uses 'unique' for this purpose, so it is only a local variable in 2 places. But a side note none the less\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts?", "_id": {"$oid": "52380dc2bd3543c15100d33f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6101#issuecomment-9059064"}
