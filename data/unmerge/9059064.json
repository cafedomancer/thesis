While I don't like having the word index twice (IndexDefinition#index_type), it is more rails friendly than overriding Object#method.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the create index code currently uses an index_type variable to specify unique. IndexDefinition uses 'unique' for this purpose, so it is only a local variable in 2 places. But a side note none the less\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts?", "_id": {"$oid": "52380dc2bd3543c15100d33f"}, "issue_id": 6101, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9059064", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6101#issuecomment-9059064", "updated_at": "2012-10-02T05:08:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kbrock/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kbrock/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kbrock/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kbrock/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kbrock", "login": "kbrock", "gravatar_id": "cf358de2534f820f5342180bb0e861ef", "html_url": "https://github.com/kbrock", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kbrock/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kbrock/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kbrock/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/cf358de2534f820f5342180bb0e861ef?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F29530de21430b7540ec3f65135f7323c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kbrock/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1930, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kbrock/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-02T05:04:02Z", "id": 9059064, "owner": "rails"}
