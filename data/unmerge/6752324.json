This file was created long before assets were added to rails.\n\nI have 2 problems with this pull request, though:\n1) I think that it would be better to reuse whatever we use in `application.rb` in application. Maybe you could try to extract it along with the other things: https://github.com/marten/rails/blob/d8fcb314fb13ba1762cf1c2441d822227b0b25ed/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/plugin_new/plugin_new_generator.rb#L299-309 (I'm not sure if you can catch both things here, if not, you could just add similar method, for example `store_bundler_definition`)\n2) It has no tests. Writing acceptance tests for this can be hard, so it would be best if after doing 1), you can add test that ensures that proper things is copied.", "_id": {"$oid": "523801b7bd3543c15100c1bd"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6941#issuecomment-6752324"}
