{"body": "I hinted at this above, but to reiterate: besides changing rails so that it supports PATCH, I'd also like to see improved support for proper PUT semantics.  Currently, rails idioms and conventions do not make this easy.  Specifically:\r\n\r\n* The common AR method used for updates is `update_attributes`. It supports updates of the full representation, but it also supports partial updates, which, as we've discussed above, is a violation of PUT semantics (at least in the mind of Fielding and other HTTP experts).\r\n* `update_attributes` also supports non-idempotent updates when used in combination w/ `accepts_nested_attributes_for`.\r\n* I think the simplest way to provide an update method that does provide proper PUT semantics is a new method, `replace_attributes`.  It would set any attribute that is not included in the hash to `nil`, and thus treat the given attribute hash as the full resource.\r\n\r\nWould the rails core team by interested in the addition of this API? I'm willing to take a stab at it, and can open another ticket to discuss further details, but figured it was worth inquiring here first.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3243620", "created_at": "2011-12-22T03:46:57Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3243620", "updated_at": "2011-12-22T03:46:57Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 505, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/myronmarston", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/42d4590355a1404230fbc9aff4dd377b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6916222172eb021e5d5f0043453078b9.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events", "gravatar_id": "42d4590355a1404230fbc9aff4dd377b", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "myronmarston", "type": "User", "id": 49391, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012170"}, "id": 3243620, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/505"}
