{"body": "That's an interesting example, and I'll confess it's not one I considered, but you can avoid it just as easily by creating a separate accessor for display purposes, e.g.\n\n```ruby\n    def announcement_html\n      self.announcement.html_safe\n    end\n```\n\nThis has the added benefit of being more obvious to someone new reading your code.\n\nThe other downside to this fix is that it wouldn't fix your code should you use\n\n```ruby\n  form.text_area :announcement\n```\n\nWhich arguably makes more sense.\n\nAnyway, it's probably best to still sanitize that html rather than trusting it completely, but that's up to you as I've no idea what your app does :)\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8512632", "created_at": "2012-09-12T22:37:47Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7611#issuecomment-8512632", "updated_at": "2012-09-12T22:37:47Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7611, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "NZKoz", "type": "User", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ddb11bd354364b900abcc"}, "id": 8512632, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7611"}
