{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2881", "repo": "rails", "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThe use case for this is when adding one object to a collection--a `has_many :through`.  In this case if the object to be added already exists, I simply want to create a join model instance with the record and cease execution on the addition to the collection so that a new object is not created.\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\n    has_many :repositories, :through => :project_repositories, :before_add => :check_to_see_if_exists\r\n\r\n    def check_to_see_if_exists(repository)\r\n      if exisiting_repo = Repository.find_by_name_and_url(repository.name, repository.url)\r\n        ProjectRepository.create!(:project => self, :repository => exisiting_repo)\r\n        return false\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that this also conforms to similar apis like returning `false` from a before_save.  More importantly, I want addition to this collection to behave the same for all additions like `<<`, etc.  More to come in a bit.
