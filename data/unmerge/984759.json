{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/258", "repo": "rails", "body": "@sikachu, thank you for graciously giving credit to me and John Reitano (@rubyduo) for the original patch and citing the original ticket & discussion--and for going beyond what we did by changing the Rails internals to use `Object#in?` where appropriate. (By the way, @rubyduo is both John Reitano and Adam King.)\n\n@dhh @jamesarosen I agree that `among` is much better than `either`.\n\n@dhh I believe @rubyduo's `Object#not_in` method was also intended for expressiveness, similar to Ruby's \"unless,\" which is why I added it to the original ticket cited above. My rationale for including it was that if the object is a complex expression, not_in puts the \"not\" in a place where it can be more easily seen:\n\n    if etc_etc.something.something && !foo_bar.xyz.abc.in?(some_list)\n\nvs.\n\n    if etc_etc.something.something && foo_bar.xyz.abc.not_in?(some_list)\n\nOf course one could argue such expressions could be broken up. :-)\n\nPersonally I don't mind the phrase \"not in\" but can understand if you dislike it. It probably does make sense to leave it out until a better name is suggested.
