{"body": "@fxn: not sure what the intention of a \"well, it works for literals\" approach is; to me, it seems confusing to have a predicate that fails irregularly with computed values but is deemed \"OK\" because it works in the console. Issues don't appear in the literal scenario until the values in question are about 16 orders of magnitude apart:\n\n```ruby\n\"%.55f\" % (1.23e16 % 1.23456789) # => \"0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n```\n\nBut, as we've seen above, doing *any* calculation with the values (subtracting two user-entered values, for instance) can lead to unfortunate results. \n\nGoing back to the original use case that brought this up, I can't think of many situations where it would be desirable to enforce \"this field must be a multiple of this\" other than scenarios that really require fixed-precision anyways (entering fractional hours for time spent, or money amounts).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7435540", "created_at": "2012-08-01T18:25:39Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7216#issuecomment-7435540", "updated_at": "2012-08-01T18:25:39Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7216, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/al2o3cr", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb20bb95ab626d93fd976af958fbc61ba.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/received_events", "gravatar_id": "6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "al2o3cr", "type": "User", "id": 1191, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fe2cbd3543c15100bcb3"}, "id": 7435540, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7216"}
