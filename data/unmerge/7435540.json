Issues don't appear in the literal scenario until the values in question are about 16 orders of magnitude apart:\n\n```ruby\n\"%.55f\" % (1.23e16 % 1.23456789) # => \"0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n```\n\nBut, as we've seen above, doing *any* calculation with the values (subtracting two user-entered values, for instance) can lead to unfortunate results. \n\nGoing back to the original use case that brought this up, I can't think of many situations where it would be desirable to enforce \"this field must be a multiple of this\" other than scenarios that really require fixed-precision anyways (entering fractional hours for time spent, or money amounts).", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fe2cbd3543c15100bcb3"}, "issue_id": 7216, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7435540", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7216#issuecomment-7435540", "updated_at": "2012-08-01T18:25:39Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr", "login": "al2o3cr", "gravatar_id": "6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243", "html_url": "https://github.com/al2o3cr", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb20bb95ab626d93fd976af958fbc61ba.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1191, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-01T18:25:39Z", "id": 7435540, "owner": "rails"}
