Issues don't appear in the literal scenario until the values in question are about 16 orders of magnitude apart:\n\n```ruby\n\"%.55f\" % (1.23e16 % 1.23456789) # => \"0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n```\n\nBut, as we've seen above, doing *any* calculation with the values (subtracting two user-entered values, for instance) can lead to unfortunate results. \n\nGoing back to the original use case that brought this up, I can't think of many situations where it would be desirable to enforce \"this field must be a multiple of this\" other than scenarios that really require fixed-precision anyways (entering fractional hours for time spent, or money amounts).", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fe2cbd3543c15100bcb3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7216#issuecomment-7435540"}
