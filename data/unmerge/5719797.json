{"body": "@pixeltrix I feel like #build_association is already having to perform some logic to determine what class to build, and this is just an extension of that behavior. However, it's well established and expected that MyClass.new should return an instance of MyClass, so I'd be uncomfortable with the idea of overriding .new to return an instance of a subclass. I'm not sure you get a whole lot by being able to write BaseClass.new(:type => 'SubClass') rather than just writing SubClass.new, but adding this behavior to #build_association gives you the ability to control the subclass without losing all the stuff you get from #build_association (i.e. adding the new instance to the association)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5719797", "created_at": "2012-05-15T16:05:43Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5813#issuecomment-5719797", "updated_at": "2012-05-15T16:05:43Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5813, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/diminish7", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7f31a917f23afac4b3a7a9482ae87843?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Feb5c505e43f84a12f3e8340a2b679567.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7f31a917f23afac4b3a7a9482ae87843", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "diminish7", "type": "User", "id": 29417, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ea094bd354364b9011819"}, "id": 5719797, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5813"}
