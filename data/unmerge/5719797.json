However, it's well established and expected that MyClass.new should return an instance of MyClass, so I'd be uncomfortable with the idea of overriding .new to return an instance of a subclass. I'm not sure you get a whole lot by being able to write BaseClass.new(:type => 'SubClass') rather than just writing SubClass.new, but adding this behavior to #build_association gives you the ability to control the subclass without losing all the stuff you get from #build_association (i.e. adding the new instance to the association)", "_id": {"$oid": "523ea094bd354364b9011819"}, "issue_id": 5813, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5719797", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5813#issuecomment-5719797", "updated_at": "2012-05-15T16:05:43Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7", "login": "diminish7", "gravatar_id": "7f31a917f23afac4b3a7a9482ae87843", "html_url": "https://github.com/diminish7", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7f31a917f23afac4b3a7a9482ae87843?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Feb5c505e43f84a12f3e8340a2b679567.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 29417, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/diminish7/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-15T16:05:43Z", "id": 5719797, "owner": "rails"}
