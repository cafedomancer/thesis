However, it's well established and expected that MyClass.new should return an instance of MyClass, so I'd be uncomfortable with the idea of overriding .new to return an instance of a subclass. I'm not sure you get a whole lot by being able to write BaseClass.new(:type => 'SubClass') rather than just writing SubClass.new, but adding this behavior to #build_association gives you the ability to control the subclass without losing all the stuff you get from #build_association (i.e. adding the new instance to the association)", "_id": {"$oid": "523ea094bd354364b9011819"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5813#issuecomment-5719797"}
