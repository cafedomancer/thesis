{"body": "Thanks, but we're not accepting such changes in the Rails source code as they are more tagged as \"cosmetic\" than \"functional\". It makes the git history hard to follow if we need to figure out something. On the other hand, if the change is related to a piece of code one's working on to fix a bug or something, that's considered fine.\n\nThanks for your contribution.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6739059", "created_at": "2012-07-03T16:23:53Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6947#issuecomment-6739059", "updated_at": "2012-07-03T16:23:53Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6947, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "type": "User", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523801a0bd3543c15100c18d"}, "id": 6739059, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6947"}
