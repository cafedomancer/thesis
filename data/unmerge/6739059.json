It makes the git history hard to follow if we need to figure out something. On the other hand, if the change is related to a piece of code one's working on to fix a bug or something, that's considered fine.\n\nThanks for your contribution.", "_id": {"$oid": "523801a0bd3543c15100c18d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6947#issuecomment-6739059"}
