Either a string has been escaped and is fine to include anywhere we're generating html, or it hasn't.\n\nThese strings of yours which contain \" and are marked as safe could likely *also* contain < and be used elsewhere, opening up a massive issue.  We shouldn't be providing a false sense of security to users letting them think \"oh it's ok to mark as safe because that other method will check if it's really-truly safe.\n\nFix the root cause of your problem.", "_id": {"$oid": "523ddb11bd354364b900abca"}, "issue_id": 7611, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8512232", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7611#issuecomment-8512232", "updated_at": "2012-09-12T22:21:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-12T22:21:04Z", "id": 8512232, "owner": "rails"}
