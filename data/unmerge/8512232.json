{"body": "My objection is not to the particulars of your implementation, even though needlessly escaping strings again is likely an expensive way to avoid this edge case.\n\nI'm objecting to the idea of providing a *different* notion of 'safe'.  Either a string has been escaped and is fine to include anywhere we're generating html, or it hasn't.\n\nThese strings of yours which contain \" and are marked as safe could likely *also* contain < and be used elsewhere, opening up a massive issue.
