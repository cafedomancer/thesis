Either a string has been escaped and is fine to include anywhere we're generating html, or it hasn't.\n\nThese strings of yours which contain \" and are marked as safe could likely *also* contain < and be used elsewhere, opening up a massive issue.  We shouldn't be providing a false sense of security to users letting them think \"oh it's ok to mark as safe because that other method will check if it's really-truly safe.\n\nFix the root cause of your problem.", "_id": {"$oid": "523ddb11bd354364b900abca"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7611#issuecomment-8512232"}
