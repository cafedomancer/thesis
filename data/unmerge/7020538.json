{"body": "Sure. That was certainly one reason, but the reason I see being cited more (by looking at the pull requests/issues) is not wanting to break existing apps. However, I'll agree with that reason for turning down pull requests, and I don't think this change means it would be unreasonable to turn them down. However, when you have some inflections that are clearly defined based on grammatical exceptions rather than the rule (such as \"f\" => \"ve\" pluralization and, come on, the archaic \"cow\" => \"kine\"?), it's a problem that the definition of that inflection is frozen. Just because the inflection rules would be \"unfrozen\" doesn't mean you can't maintain your policy of rejecting pull requests to change that initializer.\n\nThe initializer maintains its ability to be extended by the user, and should just contain a list of prevalent grammatical _rules_ (not exceptions)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7020538", "created_at": "2012-07-16T21:52:03Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7071#issuecomment-7020538", "updated_at": "2012-07-16T22:00:31Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7071, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidcelis", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3e1a626a9e0c39eb548886c253bf9644.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "davidcelis", "type": "User", "id": 36873, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380016bd3543c15100bf2e"}, "id": 7020538, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7071"}
