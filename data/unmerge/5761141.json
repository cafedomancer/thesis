{"body": "I like the idea a lot but I don't like to have to wait for the server to start and browse the app to get the error, It'd be better to throw the error when the server is starting, something like this:\n\n    $ rails server\n    You have pending migrations.\n    Try running 'bundle exec rake db:migrate'\n\nWhich is what kinda happens with Bundler:\n\n    $ rails server\n    Could not find gem 'meh' in the gems available on this machine.\n    Try running `bundle install`.\n\nI could work on that patch.
