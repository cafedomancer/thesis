In your code, every time we render a template, we create a new class, compile the template, instantiate this new class and dispatch to it.\r\n\r\nThe current approach is to compile templates just once in the view. After the template is compiled into a method, we never generate the method again, we simply dispatch to it.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dba6bd3543c1510088a7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10807#issuecomment-18733112"}
