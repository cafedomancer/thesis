That was more a postulation of what would be a reason to consider doing this, and it won't happen, so that's \"[right out](http://pythonline.com/node/239175)\".\r\n\r\nNow, you can definitely unload constants or change what comes back from const_missing. Months ago I [messed around](https://github.com/garysweaver/constance) trying to help someone get around a conflict with Journey being the same name as a model. I never really was able to come up with a feasible solution to that despite the example in the readme, but it was fun trying.\r\n\r\nAnyway- I'm totally in favor of ditching this idea.
