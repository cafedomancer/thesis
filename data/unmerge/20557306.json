You get feedback and make some changes without committing them locally. At this point. You can do this:\n$ git commit --amend\n$ git push --force \nThis will update your own fork's master branch and the PR will be updated in the rails/rails repo.\nAnother scenario, you have more than one commit in a PR and you are asked to squash them into a single commit. This is where you follow @steveklabnik's post: http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-11-08-how-to-squash-commits-in-a-github-pull-request.\nYou should never have to create a separate PR request unless you really messed up your rebase.\nHope this helps.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d625bd3543c151008289"}, "issue_id": 11326, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20557306", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11326#issuecomment-20557306", "updated_at": "2013-07-06T16:58:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz", "login": "Alamoz", "gravatar_id": "acfe9766803c7317f1143d919755d016", "html_url": "https://github.com/Alamoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/acfe9766803c7317f1143d919755d016?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb9293e1a3e6919cf510a787da16875fd.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 905505, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Alamoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-06T16:58:42Z", "id": 20557306, "owner": "rails"}
