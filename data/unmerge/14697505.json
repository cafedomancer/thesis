It's interesting functionality and i'm sure some will want it, but I don't think we can fully justify having this in Rails. Active Support is extremely conservative when it comes to extending core classes, since it's so invasive. Because of this, we're very reluctant to accept pull requests that modify core classes unless there is an overwhelming need for the functionality. @steveklabnik and @senny seem to agree. I'm closing this issue for now. Let me know if you cut a gem.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e7b6bd3543c1510095f3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9649#issuecomment-14697505"}
