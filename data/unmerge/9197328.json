{"body": "@joevandyk I looked at the datatype conversion of sequel and they use the OID to determine what type to use. This looks like a solid approach but I'm no expert with PG.\r\n\r\n@tenderlove Is there a reason Ar does not use the OID to determine the conversion to use? There are case statements using the string type all over the `postgresql_adapter.rb`. What do you think about the implementation sequel uses? Are there reasons not to take a similar approach?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9197328", "created_at": "2012-10-06T11:18:08Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7575#issuecomment-9197328", "updated_at": "2012-10-06T11:18:08Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7575, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "senny", "type": "User", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ddd5ebd354364b900ae3c"}, "id": 9197328, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7575"}
