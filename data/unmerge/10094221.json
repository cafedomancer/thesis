I figured a little text in the response body wouldn't hurt anybody.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f5cbbd3543c15100acc2"}, "issue_id": 8124, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10094221", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8124#issuecomment-10094221", "updated_at": "2012-11-06T00:17:21Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adimichele/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adimichele/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adimichele/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adimichele/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/adimichele", "login": "adimichele", "gravatar_id": "9a868e949f8d6880f74207a33898ff5b", "html_url": "https://github.com/adimichele", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adimichele/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adimichele/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adimichele/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/9a868e949f8d6880f74207a33898ff5b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F97737b32ad8b47112867f6e6e516fa87.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adimichele/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1189624, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adimichele/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-06T00:16:08Z", "id": 10094221, "owner": "rails"}
