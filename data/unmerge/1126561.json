My system runs in CEST (UTC+2), the application's time zone is set to 'Berlin' (also CEST/UTC+2) but the values are stored as UTC.\r\n\r\nI have:\r\nTimeEntry.create!(:date => '01.05.2011', :starts_at => '09:00', :ends_at => '19:00')\r\n\r\nQuerying this directly via connection.select_value gives me 2011-05-01 07:00:00. If I use the ActiveRecord object in stead, I'm getting Sun, 01 May 2011 09:00:00 CEST +02:00.\r\n\r\nNote that this could also be because my PostgreSQL server is configured this way \u2013 it's one of my first PG projects. :-) (Yes, I've seen that your patch is for MySQL \u2013 but the way Rails stores datetimes with regard to time zones is the same across databases, right?) But if I'm right, your patch would probably have to be adapted to ensure that the time zone's always UTC. If I'm wrong, don't mind me. :-)", "_id": {"$oid": "52386039bd3543c151012230"}, "issue_id": 433, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1126561", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/433#issuecomment-1126561", "updated_at": "2011-05-09T21:50:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clemens/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clemens/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clemens/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clemens/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/clemens", "login": "clemens", "gravatar_id": "5976001c9ebf095c4988855a4e102de5", "html_url": "https://github.com/clemens", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clemens/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clemens/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clemens/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5976001c9ebf095c4988855a4e102de5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff9beb1e831faf6aaec2a5cecaf1af293.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clemens/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3749, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clemens/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-09T21:50:29Z", "id": 1126561, "owner": "rails"}
