{"body": "Are you sure this would work as intended? IIRC, Rails stores (date)times in UTC. My system runs in CEST (UTC+2), the application's time zone is set to 'Berlin' (also CEST/UTC+2) but the values are stored as UTC.\r\n\r\nI have:\r\nTimeEntry.create!(:date => '01.05.2011', :starts_at => '09:00', :ends_at => '19:00')\r\n\r\nQuerying this directly via connection.select_value gives me 2011-05-01 07:00:00.

But if I'm right, your patch would probably have to be adapted to ensure that the time zone's always UTC.
