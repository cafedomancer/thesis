Metaphorically speaking, in my invoicing applications the paid flag is an ordinary resource from the client's point of view. It is convenient, better for the semantics of the applications, we like the model, etc.\r\n\r\nBut if we focus the conversation on the raw protocol, the more I read about it, the less I am convinced that HTTP requires full representation in PUT requests.\r\n\r\nHowever, Roy Fielding has stated that is the intention in a few public places. @steveklabnik quoted him, and I've also seen this patch http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/changeset/1158#file1 Roy points to in this thread http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/17415 (@mikekelly participated in that one).\r\n\r\nSo, my personal take on this is: the HTTP spec is a bit ambiguous about partial updates via PUT. This opens the door to endless controversy because it does not follow from the spec crystal clear that you cannot do it. But Roy Fielding says you should send full representations. If you want an authoritative answer, Roy's the one. Thus, if Rails as a framework has to take sides, I think the most sensible choice is agreeing that partial updates via PUT are not the way to go.\r\n\r\nThat does not mean the path to address that in Rails is to support PATCH, but at least I believe we have a sensible conclusion about this.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody disagree?\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012138"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3181362", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3181362", "updated_at": "2011-12-16T19:14:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-16T19:14:28Z", "id": 3181362, "owner": "rails"}
