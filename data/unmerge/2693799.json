Some reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Support between different browsers is still unstable. The behavior changes a lot and you have poor customization.\r\n2) If we are supporting this feature, it needs to be opt-in because it is backwards incompatible. Many integration tests through selenium would fail for example.\r\n3) ActionView::Helpers and ActiveResource are the worst (in terms of legacy) Rails code. I would strongly suggest cleaning up the house before adding more features.\r\n4) I believe those Rails form helpers have always intended to be low level. I am skeptical about adding more features, if we are going down this path, I would suggest creating a new form builder inside Rails that inherits from the base one in order to add HTML5 features. For now, I would move such behavior to plugins (as SimpleForm and Formtastic) as you did.", "_id": {"$oid": "523834a3bd3543c15100fb82"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3590#issuecomment-2693799"}
