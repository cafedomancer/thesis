{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3590", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks for the pull request but I am a bit skeptical about merging this. Some reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Support between different browsers is still unstable. The behavior changes a lot and you have poor customization.\r\n2) If we are supporting this feature, it needs to be opt-in because it is backwards incompatible. Many integration tests through selenium would fail for example.\r\n3) ActionView::Helpers and ActiveResource are the worst (in terms of legacy) Rails code. I would strongly suggest cleaning up the house before adding more features.\r\n4) I believe those Rails form helpers have always intended to be low level. I am skeptical about adding more features, if we are going down this path, I would suggest creating a new form builder inside Rails that inherits from the base one in order to add HTML5 features. For now, I would move such behavior to plugins (as SimpleForm and Formtastic) as you did.", "_id": {"$oid": "523834a3bd3543c15100fb82"}, "issue_id": 3590, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2693799", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3590#issuecomment-2693799", "updated_at": "2011-11-10T10:42:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-10T10:42:04Z", "id": 2693799, "owner": "rails"}
