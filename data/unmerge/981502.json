{"body": "-1 for inside/outside. Although `inside?` makes sense, `in?` is **much** nicer. `outside?` makes no sense at all. It's not a negative argument, it's positive. 'Foo is outside of bar' isn't telling us that foo isn't in bar, it's directly telling us it's outside of it, thus the lack of negativity. 'foo is not inside bar' would be more applicable, which is why `not_in?` works so well, but I agree the added underscore isn't nice.\r\n\r\nI'm with @josevalim with a -1 on this. It feels backward and without a suitable antonym for `in?` I think it's a lost cause", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/981502", "created_at": "2011-04-10T23:32:44Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/258#issuecomment-981502", "updated_at": "2011-04-10T23:32:44Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 258, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leejarvis/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leejarvis/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leejarvis/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/leejarvis", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leejarvis/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/leejarvis", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leejarvis/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/9077af710bdadc972a7898e457bf6ec1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd101a6f0838d9a7f8bbc049e1237f86e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leejarvis/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leejarvis/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9077af710bdadc972a7898e457bf6ec1", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leejarvis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "leejarvis", "type": "User", "id": 197567, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/leejarvis/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386422bd3543c1510125a0"}, "id": 981502, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/258"}
