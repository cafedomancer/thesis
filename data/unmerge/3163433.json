{"body": "@steveklabnik that post from Jan is written on the basis that it is _impossible_ to make an idempotent partial update. I disagree.\r\n\r\nIn some ways it's irrelevant anyway; people are already using partial PUT requests that are intended as idempotent.\r\n\r\nMoving to POST would:\r\n- have a negative impact on clients since its non-idempotent nature has now made the requests non-repeatable\r\n- seem to produce zero appreciable benefits over the current practice\r\n\r\nSupposedly, RFC2616 has been enforcing 'full PUT' for over 12 years and we're still yet to see any significant mechanisms that leverage this systemic agreement on the fullness of PUT requests.. that should tell us something (i.e. it's a useless semantic). Add in the fact we have implementations, like Rails, which blatantly disregard it and don't appear to suffer any real negative consequences..
