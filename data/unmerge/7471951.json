Right now the API is very clear and `attr_accessible` is well documented.\n\nA explanation more \n\n1) It has nothing to do with the `attr_*` macros, but it is still related with attributes. `attr` seems a good prefix to something that deal with attributes.\n\n2) You are right about this one.\n\n3) Now that it will be removed and we don't will add it in every model by default I don't think that we should deal with this rename. We will remove `attr_accessible` either from the oficial documentation so new Rails developers should only know about this from legacy code. So we don't need to make it more \"understandable\". I think that adding an alias will make the things more confusing to newcomers that can see projects using `attr_accessible` and using `mass_assignable`. Even in the same project this can occur.\n\nLets wait to see what the others think.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fdedbd3543c15100bc2d"}, "issue_id": 7241, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7471951", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7241#issuecomment-7471951", "updated_at": "2012-08-03T00:03:25Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca", "login": "rafaelfranca", "gravatar_id": "0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03", "html_url": "https://github.com/rafaelfranca", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2c7b84fa30f0cea96a90729afe2970a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 47848, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-03T00:03:25Z", "id": 7471951, "owner": "rails"}
