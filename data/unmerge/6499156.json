{"body": "@carlosantoniodasilva \n>  this will raise more confusion than just raising an exception when the name gets too long\n\nI disagree. As a user who hit this on unnamed indexes (auto-named), it was incredibly confusing because at the time I didn't know how Rails named indexes. Because of this we now always supply names to our indexes so we don't get in this mess again. Shame on me for having wordy table and column names.\n\n> This will force the user to give the index a proper :name.\n\nthe alternative is that Rails chooses a bad one that may make your life more difficult down the road\n\nIMHO, the name (manual or auto-generated) should be validated as 5 characters less than the actual max. This will prevent rails from throwing up when certain migrations would cause them to go over the limit by prefixing \"temp_\". \n\nHaving an index which is 59-64 characters long is an error, it's just a matter of how and when you hit it. This argument put forth on this thread is that it is better to catch the error when trying to create the index in the first place than wait for it to blow up later.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6499156", "created_at": "2012-06-22T02:11:13Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1993#issuecomment-6499156", "updated_at": "2012-06-22T02:11:36Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 1993, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/softwaregravy", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a88bec2f50dd9f21cd282432cb9e7a92?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4c9b5a6919028b0fbe0601f9428681d5.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/received_events", "gravatar_id": "a88bec2f50dd9f21cd282432cb9e7a92", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "softwaregravy", "type": "User", "id": 426690, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523fe6c0bd354364b901c1cc"}, "id": 6499156, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1993"}
