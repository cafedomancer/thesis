It seems fine, although reading the code I think that `new_target` and `target` are not the same. `new_target` gets merged into the existing target. Example:\n\n``` ruby\npost.comments = [c1, c2]\npost.comments.replace([c3, c1]) # => [c3, c1]\npost.comments # => [c1, c3]\n```\n\nWhether this matters is debatable.
