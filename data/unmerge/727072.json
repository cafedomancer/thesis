It doesn't make sense to tell people that this new \"lambdas in default_scope\" feature may not work properly if you or your gems authors declare your named or default scopes the old way.\r\n\r\nI'll try to add more tests later this week. The ones you have in a commit above don't rely on `without_default` so you're ok to check your code against them.", "_id": {"$oid": "523866a7bd3543c151012821"}, "issue_id": 169, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/727072", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/169#issuecomment-727072", "updated_at": "2011-02-01T00:47:56Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amw/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amw/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amw/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amw/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/amw", "login": "amw", "gravatar_id": "550103fa7ffccf284804c3eecc1d307b", "html_url": "https://github.com/amw", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amw/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amw/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amw/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/550103fa7ffccf284804c3eecc1d307b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8bb2c536d0fb580ce30b60ca38f773dd.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 29783, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/amw/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-02-01T00:47:56Z", "id": 727072, "owner": "rails"}
