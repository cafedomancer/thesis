My subclassing example would return 400 response even if parsing request params would succeed, but later in an action you'd make a request to external service and fail parsing an invalid response from it.\n\nYou also can't override `ParamsParser#parse_formatted_parameters` and return a custom response from that, because result of this method is assigned to `params` variable (https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/params_parser.rb#L16-22).\n\nIt looks like currently many people are inserting custom middleware before `ParamsParser` that's only responsible for parsing request params and returning custom response if it fails, but it actually results in parsing request params twice if everything is ok.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fbbfbd3543c15100b861"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7424#issuecomment-7962169"}
