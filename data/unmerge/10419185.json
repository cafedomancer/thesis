He is just starting with Rails and he was confused because ```router.rb``` didn't have a block argument, but the ```create_table``` had one.\r\n\r\nIn general I don't use ```instance_eval``` often. But I think in this case it makes sense. Since I view ```create_table``` just as declaration, and the need for passing a table definition variable just as a boilerplate.  If we use ```instance_eval```, the code will become more readable in my opinion.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f503bd3543c15100ab30"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8226#issuecomment-10419185"}
