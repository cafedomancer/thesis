{"body": "The idea for the feature, came from a friend of mine. He is just starting with Rails and he was confused because ```router.rb``` didn't have a block argument, but the ```create_table``` had one.\r\n\r\nIn general I don't use ```instance_eval``` often. But I think in this case it makes sense. Since I view ```create_table``` just as declaration, and the need for passing a table definition variable just as a boilerplate.  If we use ```instance_eval```, the code will become more readable in my opinion.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10419185", "created_at": "2012-11-15T18:21:34Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8226#issuecomment-10419185", "updated_at": "2012-11-15T18:21:34Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8226, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RStankov/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RStankov/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RStankov/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/RStankov", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RStankov/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/RStankov", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RStankov/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7a0e72a6f55811246bb5d9a946fd2e49?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9365ae980268ef00988a8048fa732226.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RStankov/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RStankov/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7a0e72a6f55811246bb5d9a946fd2e49", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RStankov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "RStankov", "type": "User", "id": 9867, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/RStankov/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f503bd3543c15100ab30"}, "id": 10419185, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8226"}
