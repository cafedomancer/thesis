{"body": "Thanks @jwaldrip, but I don't see a use case where I'd not like the inherited class to have the same attr value as the parent one. That's basically the proposal of `class_attribute` in my mind. At the last resort, if I really wanted to have that functionality, I think I'd rather use Class attr accessors: `class << self; attr_accessor :foo; end`.\r\n\r\nAbout the refactoring, I *think* the implementation uses `class_eval` because it's faster than `define_method`.\r\n\r\nLets get some more feedback first. Thanks for your contribution!\r\n\r\n/cc @josevalim @rafaelfranca ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11080741", "created_at": "2012-12-06T11:20:46Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8435#issuecomment-11080741", "updated_at": "2012-12-06T11:20:46Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8435, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "type": "User", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f33abd3543c15100a7b1"}, "id": 11080741, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8435"}
