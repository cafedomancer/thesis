That's basically the proposal of `class_attribute` in my mind. At the last resort, if I really wanted to have that functionality, I think I'd rather use Class attr accessors: `class << self; attr_accessor :foo; end`.\r\n\r\nAbout the refactoring, I *think* the implementation uses `class_eval` because it's faster than `define_method`.\r\n\r\nLets get some more feedback first. Thanks for your contribution!\r\n\r\n/cc @josevalim @rafaelfranca ", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f33abd3543c15100a7b1"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8435#issuecomment-11080741"}
