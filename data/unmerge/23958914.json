It should be on the developer to set the sort order on `first` if they want it in id order. This actually provides inconsistent behavior with the old find first. With the query I use as an example, the following will be two different results:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nScore.select(:score, 'rank() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC)').first\r\n\r\n#will differ from\r\n\r\nScore.select(:score, 'rank() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC)').to_a.first\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the query will not have the sort by id applied when `to_a` is called.
