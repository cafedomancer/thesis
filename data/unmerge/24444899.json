Actually, guides.rubyonrails.org points to the last guides which are Rails 4.0.0. This removal concerns Rails 3.2 and is still mentioned [on the 3.2.13 guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.13/getting_started.html#setting-the-application-home-page) ; In 4.0 this file doesn't exist anymore.\r\n\r\nAlso please, the next time, could you please add `[ci skip]` to your commit message ?
