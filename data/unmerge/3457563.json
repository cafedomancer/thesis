{"body": "I agree that having to do the runtime detection in the Rails generator script is not ideal.  But as it stands now, a newly created Rails project will not run on Linux (unless they've previously installed node.js) without the user having to look at the error message, go to the URL in the execjs error message, and install one of the gems listed there.  This is not a problem for anyone in here looking at the Rails source code, but this is going to be one more roadblock for users totally new to Rails, who at this point are probably thinking \"Rails was supposed to be easy to get up and running!\".  They're probably already overwhelmed by bundle, rake, and rails.  This is one more thing to confuse them.  If they do actually want to get it running, they're going to have to decide from the list of 6 things on that list.  I imagine they won't want to install node.js, or Spidermonkey, I know when I first ran in to this I was a little offended that I might have to install node.js for something in Rails.  So they'll want to go the gem route, but then, they have to decide on which one.  Then, they'll have to at least get some idea of how gems work, and then learn a little about bundler and how to add gems to the Gemfile.  And this will be the users very first impression of actually using Rails.  To me this is too much to ask when it can all be solved by simply checking if one of the executables is on the system in Rails.\r\n\r\nAnd I understand being concerned about solving essentially an execjs problem in Rails.  However Rails requires execjs, so an execjs problem is essentially a Rails problem.
