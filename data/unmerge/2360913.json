Also, by removing one smell, you add two others - a duplication (to avoid it, we'll have to add even 1 more stack level and method dispatching), and two methods with __seven__ formal parameters! (btw, such a long signature in two parallel methods itself is a duplication, that can't be avoided in this solution).\r\n\r\nI've looked through discussions and can only agree with @josevalim and @jonleighton, that just because it's currently slow doesn't mean that we should resign ourselves to it always being slow.\r\n\r\nThis is not a good refactor, I think.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383883bd3543c151010007"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3290#issuecomment-2360913"}
