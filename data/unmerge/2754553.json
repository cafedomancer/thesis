There are people with blog posts, printed books and screen casts where they do\r\n\r\n    form_for(@user, :html=>{:method=>:put}) \r\n\r\nOr \r\n\r\n    link_to(\"something\", @user, :remote=>true, :method=>:put)\r\n\r\nSwitching the default will make all of those tutorials and chunks of code fail with routing errors, and \"the RFC says X\" doesn't seem like anywhere *near* a good enough reason to do that.</rant>\r\n\r\nMaybe for a 4.0 change but absent some genuine bug or difficulty we can't do this in a random minor release.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c1510120f5"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2754553", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-2754553", "updated_at": "2011-11-16T01:58:01Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-16T01:58:01Z", "id": 2754553, "owner": "rails"}
