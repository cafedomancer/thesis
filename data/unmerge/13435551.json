{"body": "`validates_length_of` can also be used to validate size of associations and arrays, so we cannot change this behaviour without adding a deprecation and a proper mechanism to validate those.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is more of a typecast issue. When you assign an array to title, it should be typecast to string. This way, the validator would already receive the properly typecast value. This conversion could also happen when accessing the `params` value, ensure `params[:title]` returns only strings unless explicitly said.\r\n\r\nThat said, I agree there is space for improvements here but it must be solved elsewhere, not in the validator.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13435551", "created_at": "2013-02-12T14:49:56Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9235#issuecomment-13435551", "updated_at": "2013-02-12T14:49:56Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9235, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ebdcbd3543c151009bcd"}, "id": 13435551, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9235"}
