When you assign an array to title, it should be typecast to string. This way, the validator would already receive the properly typecast value. This conversion could also happen when accessing the `params` value, ensure `params[:title]` returns only strings unless explicitly said.\r\n\r\nThat said, I agree there is space for improvements here but it must be solved elsewhere, not in the validator.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ebdcbd3543c151009bcd"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9235#issuecomment-13435551"}
