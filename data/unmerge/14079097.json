Most stack overflow answers say to remove the verification. \r\n\r\nEventually my conclusion was:\r\nOn a login/new-session action, skip verify and put the token in `response.headers[\"X-CSRF-Token\"]`. The client can then watch for the header, and send back the last one it received.\r\n\r\nI haven't tested it to any good extent, but is this a good/safe way to go about it?
