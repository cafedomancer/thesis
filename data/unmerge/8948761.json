If it is just displaying the home page I don't see why.\n\nPages does make sense if you are using it to handle other pages (about/privacy as you mentioned). In that case how about using this route instead of `resources :pages`\n\n```ruby\nget 'pages/:page', to: 'pages#show', as: 'page'\n```\n\nIf this is intended to be an educational example I don't think `resources` is a good fit since it produces many more routes. Even with `only: :show` it doesn't feel right.\n\nI still think this is too complex overall for the default app generator.", "_id": {"$oid": "523dcb5dbd354364b900a145"}, "issue_id": 7771, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8948761", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7771#issuecomment-8948761", "updated_at": "2012-09-27T18:44:31Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb", "login": "ryanb", "gravatar_id": "8dbf316d36ff66aad4869a4fc3cfbd37", "html_url": "https://github.com/ryanb", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/8dbf316d36ff66aad4869a4fc3cfbd37?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbd4c9ab730f5513206b999ec0d90d1fb.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 161, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryanb/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-27T18:42:41Z", "id": 8948761, "owner": "rails"}
