If it is just displaying the home page I don't see why.\n\nPages does make sense if you are using it to handle other pages (about/privacy as you mentioned). In that case how about using this route instead of `resources :pages`\n\n```ruby\nget 'pages/:page', to: 'pages#show', as: 'page'\n```\n\nIf this is intended to be an educational example I don't think `resources` is a good fit since it produces many more routes. Even with `only: :show` it doesn't feel right.\n\nI still think this is too complex overall for the default app generator.", "_id": {"$oid": "523dcb5dbd354364b900a145"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7771#issuecomment-8948761"}
