You identified the problem and solution, and I better integrated it into the codebase and clarified the tests. That's the beauty of git - it's an open system where we can all improve on the work of others.\r\n\r\nSeems the last remaining bit is to add a changelog for your work. Would you be up for pulling from my branch, adding a changelog for your work, and updating this pull request? I would close my pull request if you did that. Otherwise I'm happy to write a changelog on your behalf.", "_id": {"$oid": "523ec1f2bd354364b9012729"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5476#issuecomment-21664431"}
