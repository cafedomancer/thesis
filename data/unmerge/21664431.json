{"body": "Hey @tandem-softworks - sorry that you feel otherwise, but from my perspective we are working together. You identified the problem and solution, and I better integrated it into the codebase and clarified the tests. That's the beauty of git - it's an open system where we can all improve on the work of others.\r\n\r\nSeems the last remaining bit is to add a changelog for your work. Would you be up for pulling from my branch, adding a changelog for your work, and updating this pull request? I would close my pull request if you did that. Otherwise I'm happy to write a changelog on your behalf.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/21664431", "created_at": "2013-07-27T12:02:26Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5476#issuecomment-21664431", "updated_at": "2013-07-27T12:02:26Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5476, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/Empact", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b4493ae064e6e2841f376fd1dc12b7ba?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbaed9f51d412c2514ee46a0942138ad6.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/received_events", "gravatar_id": "b4493ae064e6e2841f376fd1dc12b7ba", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "Empact", "type": "User", "id": 5470, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Empact/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ec1f2bd354364b9012729"}, "id": 21664431, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5476"}
