Unless you have some kind of compiler that turns css files into inline style on the run, the alternative to this is to hardcode a bunch of inline string styles which is even worse.\r\n\r\nA lot of things Rails supports is arguably bad practice - such as inline onClick JS as opposed to unobtrusive observers. But at the end of the day, IMO the user should have the choice. This PR isn't in any way forcing or encouraging users to use inline styles.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/19932696", "created_at": "2013-06-24T20:16:49Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11072#issuecomment-19932696", "updated_at": "2013-06-24T20:18:35Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 11072, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/egilburg", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F552d65b6e9616642fd0217dc7f8361bd.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/received_events", "gravatar_id": "cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "egilburg", "type": "User", "id": 242532, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d8febd3543c151008547"}, "id": 19932696, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/11072"}
