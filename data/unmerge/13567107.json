{"body": "@calebthompson this comes at the cost of expanding your surface API. Imagine this code:\r\n\r\n    if author.has_posts?\r\n      author.posts.each do |post|\r\n        ...\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nAfter this patch, I would have to mock both `has_posts?` and `posts` in the cases where I have one or more posts. It is much more practical instead to work on a collection of posts (and since you mentioned Demeter Law, it would also be fine as long as you keep the posts interaction inside its own method).\r\n\r\nIn any case, Rails uses the approach of `posts <<`, `posts.build` and `posts.any?` instead of `author.add_post`, `author.build_post` and `author.has_posts?` for quite some time and I don't see a strong benefit to go astray in this particular case.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13567107", "created_at": "2013-02-14T17:21:16Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9280#issuecomment-13567107", "updated_at": "2013-02-14T17:21:16Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9280, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237eaeabd3543c151009a96"}, "id": 13567107, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9280"}
