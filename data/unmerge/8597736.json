There is also a related ticket #1143, that mentions adding `./` as a way to use relative path.\n\nWhile I like the idea of making things simpler, this would unfortunately break almost all of the apps and would make the update to 4.0 much harder. That's why I would vote to implement #1143 (I think it will be quite easy to add, I can implement if it's the way to go).", "_id": {"$oid": "523807c9bd3543c15100cb45"}, "issue_id": 6478, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8597736", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6478#issuecomment-8597736", "updated_at": "2012-09-16T19:01:01Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus", "login": "drogus", "gravatar_id": "582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30", "html_url": "https://github.com/drogus", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3202111cf90e7c816a472aaceb72b0df.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5004, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-16T19:01:01Z", "id": 8597736, "owner": "rails"}
