Just one more question about diffs:\r\n\r\nThe only place in Rails where `Hash#diff` is used is:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# FIXME: minitest does object diffs, do we need to have our own?\r\nmessage ||= sprintf(\"The recognized options <%s> did not match <%s>, difference: <%s>\",\r\n  request.path_parameters, expected_options, expected_options.diff(request.path_parameters))\r\nassert_equal(expected_options, request.path_parameters, message)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo do we really need `Hash#diff` at all? Maybe it's ok to drop this method support in `AS` and just use MiniTest's one (with proper descriptive formatting)?", "_id": {"$oid": "523da671bd354364b9008bd4"}, "issue_id": 8142, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10227297", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8142#issuecomment-10227297", "updated_at": "2012-11-09T14:04:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikitug/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikitug/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikitug/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikitug/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikitug", "login": "nikitug", "gravatar_id": "956e1f1d80bf09a129a5d0e483667794", "html_url": "https://github.com/nikitug", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikitug/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikitug/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikitug/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/956e1f1d80bf09a129a5d0e483667794?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc09403c3de29be3f888fa2a5dd6cae9c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikitug/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 237785, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nikitug/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-09T14:04:20Z", "id": 10227297, "owner": "rails"}
