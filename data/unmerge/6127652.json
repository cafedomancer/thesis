{"body": "It seems that the only reason for rejecting this patch is the fear that people may run `bundle update` and surprisingly update `rails`. Wow, why don't we prevent them from overwriting Ruby methods, oh wait... People can harm themselves in thousand different ways when executing wrong commands. That's why we have SCM tools like git, don't we ? If you executed `bundle update` you are already trying to update in 1 step hundreds of gems and that probably won't work.\n\nAnyway, no one is crazy enough to just update and deploy to production right ? We do run tests before doing deploy. If I update rails, or any other gem in that matter and my tests are passing then I choose to believe that I can deploy it. It is equally possible that there was a unknown / untested bug in previous Rails version as that it is in the updated one. I choose to believe in progress and that rails is getting better and that upgrading often is a good thing.\n\nLet's think about 2 usecases:\n\na) Someone executed `bundle update` (accidentally or not). Current status: All gems marked with `~>` except rails are getting upgraded. Good luck with that. With merged pull request: All gems marked with `~>` are getting upgraded. If tests are passing then IMHO the application is working fine. If tests don't pass then I can just revert changes with git\n\nb) Someone executed `bundle update rails`. Current status: `rails` is not going to upgrade. Probably not what I wanted right? With merged pull request: `rails` is upgraded to newest version with possibly some security updates. Good, that's what I wanted obviously.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6127652", "created_at": "2012-06-05T15:21:03Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6610#issuecomment-6127652", "updated_at": "2012-06-05T15:21:03Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6610, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/paneq", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/9b81cae1fb43808ac23a2188258ca9e4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F180bb054f1a36e1777b05a0664a7eb71.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9b81cae1fb43808ac23a2188258ca9e4", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "paneq", "type": "User", "id": 65587, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/paneq/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380636bd3543c15100c8a8"}, "id": 6127652, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6610"}
