{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10287", "repo": "rails", "body": "Yes by deleting it would execute for all contexts. But that's the goal here . `on: :save` does not mean anything in Active Record. It's as good as no option for `:on`.\r\n\r\nNow that I think about it, fixing by deleting feels like a hack. \r\n\r\nAs you suggested there should be a way to say in case of `:save` do both `:create` and `:update`. Will study the code a bit more.
