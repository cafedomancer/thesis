But that's the goal here . `on: :save` does not mean anything in Active Record. It's as good as no option for `:on`.\r\n\r\nNow that I think about it, fixing by deleting feels like a hack. \r\n\r\nAs you suggested there should be a way to say in case of `:save` do both `:create` and `:update`. Will study the code a bit more. Thanks for the feedback @josevalim .", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e0e5bd3543c151008f1e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10287#issuecomment-16746232"}
