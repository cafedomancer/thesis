To me that is to give each environment the ability to override database.yml with it's own environment config. It shouldn't blow up if database.yml is missing though.\r\n\r\nGreat catch. And thanks.\r\n\r\nGlenn", "_id": {"$oid": "523813aabd3543c15100dae6"}, "issue_id": 5721, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4938694", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5721#issuecomment-4938694", "updated_at": "2012-04-03T22:51:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glenngillen/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glenngillen/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glenngillen/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glenngillen/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/glenngillen", "login": "glenngillen", "gravatar_id": "d72b1e5724b5c20a36d78730b50d8f7b", "html_url": "https://github.com/glenngillen", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glenngillen/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glenngillen/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glenngillen/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/d72b1e5724b5c20a36d78730b50d8f7b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F630b168462fa22c2e5e80d5175b99ab7.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glenngillen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 855109, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/glenngillen/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-03T22:51:23Z", "id": 4938694, "owner": "rails"}
