{"body": "The issue for us is that Rails 3.0.19 allowed this, among other things (like single-quotes rather than double-quotes), whereas rails 3.0.20 does not.  One does not typically expect this sort of drastic change in functionality in a point-release that may break lots of things.  We worked around it with a monkeypatch (based on this pull request), because we had to.  Given a time machine, rails would never have allowed this invalid json, but since it was allowed, many users consider the abrupt change a regression in functionality, even if it is technically \"correct\" now.\r\n\r\nTo anyone else refraining from updating to 3.0.20 because of this, the monkeypatch route may be your best option.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14074628", "created_at": "2013-02-25T20:48:56Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9107#issuecomment-14074628", "updated_at": "2013-02-25T20:48:56Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9107, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rdickey/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rdickey/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rdickey/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rdickey", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rdickey/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/rdickey", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rdickey/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2c76d728d307d3c92901c574e8b029c8?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F88d40598f3d582001b670db88b7919fd.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rdickey/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rdickey/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2c76d728d307d3c92901c574e8b029c8", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rdickey/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "rdickey", "type": "User", "id": 889517, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rdickey/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ecebbd3543c151009d6f"}, "id": 14074628, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9107"}
