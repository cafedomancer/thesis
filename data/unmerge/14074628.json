One does not typically expect this sort of drastic change in functionality in a point-release that may break lots of things.  We worked around it with a monkeypatch (based on this pull request), because we had to.  Given a time machine, rails would never have allowed this invalid json, but since it was allowed, many users consider the abrupt change a regression in functionality, even if it is technically \"correct\" now.\r\n\r\nTo anyone else refraining from updating to 3.0.20 because of this, the monkeypatch route may be your best option.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ecebbd3543c151009d6f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9107#issuecomment-14074628"}
