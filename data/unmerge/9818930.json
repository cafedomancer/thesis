At first, the example totally confused me because you write revert { create_table ... } to drop the table. When I read this code, it reads as \"Do the opposite thing of creating a table\", which seems confusing.\r\n\r\nThis was my issue looking at the code as well.  My best guess is that this is defining changes that can be rolled back via `db:migrate:down` vs. things that cannot be rolled back?\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, I would argue that the approach should be opposite.  In other words, Rails should assume that everything can be reverted unless otherwise specified.  e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef change\r\n  irreversible do\r\n    create_table(:horses) { ... }\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  create_table(:cows) { ... }\r\nend\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "523dda17bd354364b900aae9"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7627#issuecomment-9818930"}
