{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7627", "repo": "rails", "body": "> The code seems fine. At first, the example totally confused me because you write revert { create_table ... } to drop the table. When I read this code, it reads as \"Do the opposite thing of creating a table\", which seems confusing.\r\n\r\nThis was my issue looking at the code as well.  My best guess is that this is defining changes that can be rolled back via `db:migrate:down` vs. things that cannot be rolled back?\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, I would argue that the approach should be opposite.  In other words, Rails should assume that everything can be reverted unless otherwise specified.  e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef change\r\n  irreversible do\r\n    create_table(:horses) { ... }\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  create_table(:cows) { ... }\r\nend\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "523dda17bd354364b900aae9"}, "issue_id": 7627, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9818930", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7627#issuecomment-9818930", "updated_at": "2012-10-26T16:37:31Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins", "login": "mhuggins", "gravatar_id": "781f66c42983ae7ee3123bbd620d8568", "html_url": "https://github.com/mhuggins", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/781f66c42983ae7ee3123bbd620d8568?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8cc10a343f7cacddbbc5488786f3f22b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 169093, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhuggins/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-26T16:37:31Z", "id": 9818930, "owner": "rails"}
