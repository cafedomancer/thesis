I think it's a bit janky to set the `pool` option by tacking on a `pool` argument to the `DATABASE_URL` or even when passing in a url as a string to `ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection`\r\n\r\nI wonder if there's a compromise in a future PR? Something like\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nurl = ENV['DATABASE_URL']\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection url, { pool: 30 }\r\n# instead of\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection \"#{url}?pool=30\"\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "523813aabd3543c15100daea"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5721#issuecomment-12928414"}
