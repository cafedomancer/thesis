{"body": "I'm running into the same issue as @stevenharman. I think it's a bit janky to set the `pool` option by tacking on a `pool` argument to the `DATABASE_URL` or even when passing in a url as a string to `ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection`\r\n\r\nI wonder if there's a compromise in a future PR? Something like\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nurl = ENV['DATABASE_URL']\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection url, { pool: 30 }\r\n# instead of\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection \"#{url}?pool=30\"\r\n```", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12928414", "created_at": "2013-01-31T05:24:48Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5721#issuecomment-12928414", "updated_at": "2013-01-31T05:24:48Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5721, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jc00ke/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jc00ke/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jc00ke/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jc00ke", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jc00ke/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jc00ke", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jc00ke/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/8c94d965389694bd5adc14679977fd5d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F63cbf554a9356c3e430e16dbafb1a6db.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jc00ke/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jc00ke/received_events", "gravatar_id": "8c94d965389694bd5adc14679977fd5d", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jc00ke/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jc00ke", "type": "User", "id": 18191, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jc00ke/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523813aabd3543c15100daea"}, "id": 12928414, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5721"}
