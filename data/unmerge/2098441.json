{"body": "@dmathieu I agree with you that this helper don't have a interface consistent with other helpers. But as I see, it can't be completely consistent. \r\n\r\nMost helpers render one HTML element, so they offer an argument to set the attributes/values of this HTML element (html_options hash argument). But on this case, the helper renders multiple HTML elements. Though html_options could be used anyway, even we're setting the attributes/values of more than one HTML element, we still need to set the parent element of each flash message. So, we would include on this hash a :tag/:element/:parent_element key, breaking the consistency of html_options, which usually only setts attributes/values, but now is setting attributes/values and the parent element.\r\n\r\nBut again, I can change the interface without problems, also because you have a definitely valid point. I just need a guideline from someone from the core team of which approach to follow, assuming they agree with this helper.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2098441", "created_at": "2011-09-14T21:38:50Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3009#issuecomment-2098441", "updated_at": "2011-09-14T21:38:50Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3009, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/elomarns", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/df23382db80111520deb86d46a47f70f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2bec63f5d312303621583b97ff7c68bf.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/received_events", "gravatar_id": "df23382db80111520deb86d46a47f70f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "elomarns", "type": "User", "id": 13167, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elomarns/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383c0fbd3543c15101037b"}, "id": 2098441, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3009"}
