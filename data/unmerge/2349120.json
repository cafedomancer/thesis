Maybe the git history can reveal more of the intention here.\r\n\r\nI think it's best to support correct use of the header: the first address is the client IP, the second address in the first proxy, the third address is the second proxy, and so on.", "_id": {"$oid": "523fe378bd354364b901bf90"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2035#issuecomment-2349120"}
