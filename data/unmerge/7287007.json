What if I'm really using the `layout` option as a `local` to pass to my template? That'd break.\n\nAlso, this method api is pretty clear: you give the variable or partial name, and locals, no options. For giving options you have to explicitly use `render :partial`. (Note that you should be able to use `render partial: @variable, layout: 'foo'`).\n\nThanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ff40bd3543c15100bde7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7169#issuecomment-7287007"}
