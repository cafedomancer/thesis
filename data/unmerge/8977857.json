{"body": "Amazing that this has never received the attention that it deserves. I created a partializer gem in order to facilitate the partials path hell, when going beyond one nested level of partials. I don't like any file to be much more than ~60 lines, then I discovered Cells which is a much nicer solution.

Most MVC frameworks suffer from a lack of proper view partitioning. I recall an even worse nightmare on the Java stack.
