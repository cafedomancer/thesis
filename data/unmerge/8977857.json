I created a partializer gem in order to facilitate the partials path hell, when going beyond one nested level of partials. I don't like any file to be much more than ~60 lines, then I discovered Cells which is a much nicer solution. The views/partials in Rails is still such a primitive solution and something like Cells (or apotomo) really ought to be built into Rails IMO. Most MVC frameworks suffer from a lack of proper view partitioning. I recall an even worse nightmare on the Java stack.
