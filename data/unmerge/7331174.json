Apologies for not making it more clear, but all we need is a `AM::Observers.load_all` or `AM::Observers.eager_load` that *will* load all observers and force the classes they observe to be loaded too. The reason a flag is not enough is because we don't know if we will eager load or not just until late in the initialization process.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e0b2cbd354364b900cd8b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7064#issuecomment-7331174"}
