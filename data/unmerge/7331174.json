{"body": "> @josevalim I added ActiveModel::Base.eager_load which will make all initialized observes load all their models, is that what you had in mind ?\n\nSorry, no. Apologies for not making it more clear, but all we need is a `AM::Observers.load_all` or `AM::Observers.eager_load` that *will* load all observers and force the classes they observe to be loaded too. The reason a flag is not enough is because we don't know if we will eager load or not just until late in the initialization process.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7331174", "created_at": "2012-07-28T07:23:27Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7064#issuecomment-7331174", "updated_at": "2012-07-28T07:23:27Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7064, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e0b2cbd354364b900cd8b"}, "id": 7331174, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7064"}
