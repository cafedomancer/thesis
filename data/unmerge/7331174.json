Apologies for not making it more clear, but all we need is a `AM::Observers.load_all` or `AM::Observers.eager_load` that *will* load all observers and force the classes they observe to be loaded too. The reason a flag is not enough is because we don't know if we will eager load or not just until late in the initialization process.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e0b2cbd354364b900cd8b"}, "issue_id": 7064, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7331174", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7064#issuecomment-7331174", "updated_at": "2012-07-28T07:23:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-28T07:23:27Z", "id": 7331174, "owner": "rails"}
