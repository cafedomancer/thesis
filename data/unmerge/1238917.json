I agree completely on the has_secure verbiage.  I just think internally it might be more cleanly implemented in ActiveModel as a coded column.  Or maybe not. Just a suggestion.  I can't agree more about the spelling issue.  :-)", "_id": {"$oid": "52385c96bd3543c151011f31"}, "issue_id": 1159, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1238917", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1159#issuecomment-1238917", "updated_at": "2011-05-25T22:44:25Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs", "login": "MDaubs", "gravatar_id": "e9b949c8749222225501c99e8e8ad9ff", "html_url": "https://github.com/MDaubs", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e9b949c8749222225501c99e8e8ad9ff?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa71c1d3324103addc6c422fa5e374d6f.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 127900, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MDaubs/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-25T22:44:25Z", "id": 1238917, "owner": "rails"}
