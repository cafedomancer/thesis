{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7300", "repo": "rails", "body": "Hi all, I'm watching the rails repository just in the last few days so if I write something wrong excuse me :).\n\nSaid this, I've seen the code and I've a couple of doubts. First of all, what the method should return when the min parameter is greater than max? This condition is not checked, for example if I call ```5.limit(10, 1)``` what I should get? 5 or 10 as the current implementation do? Probably it would be a good thing to raise an ```ArgumentError``` exception if the min parameter is greater than max.\n\nAnother doubt is about the use of 2 arguments insteat of a single Range object: I think who will use this method could want to use a range instead.\n\nSpeaking of who will use this method, I guess the name of the method could be better, ```limit``` doesn't explain well what it does, what about something like `constrain_in_range`, `limit_in_range` or at least `limit_in`? So you could call it like this ```vote.constrain_in_range(18, 30)```. Still I'm not sure about the real-life benefits of this addition.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fd70bd3543c15100bb45"}, "issue_id": 7300, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7667190", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7300#issuecomment-7667190", "updated_at": "2012-08-11T14:34:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xoen/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xoen/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xoen/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xoen/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/xoen", "login": "xoen", "gravatar_id": "7428d2de67276504c39bee5602b6ce99", "html_url": "https://github.com/xoen", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xoen/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xoen/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xoen/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7428d2de67276504c39bee5602b6ce99?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ffdcb815b485785b3e601eabdeeded53c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xoen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 238563, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/xoen/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-11T14:34:20Z", "id": 7667190, "owner": "rails"}
