The one part you can't tailor is the key for the identifier. \n\nThe pain comes in when you have the following route:\n```ruby\nresources :users\n```\nand a model for which you don't want to expose a sequential id (perhaps to guard the total user count)\n```ruby\ndef to_param\n  self.api_key #GUID\nend\n```\nand finally in your controller you are currently forced to do something offensive like this:\n```ruby\nclass UsersController\n  ...\n  def show\n    @user = User.find_by_api_key(params[:id])\n  end\n  ...\nend \n```\nBut wait, what's in params[:id]? Was it a sequential id? Was it a GUID? It's not clear from the code. Nor are my expectations of what's in the params very clear for anyone trying to figure out how to call my controller. \n\nThis pull request makes it easy to adhere to conventions, which is especially powerful when exposing an API to third parties who would rather see convention than wade through documentation. By adding the :id_as option, the controller becomes more expressive to the developer while still lending itself to the standard restful routes.\n\nAssuming that all makes sense, Ryan and I will resubmit, addressing the nested routes and base our branch off master.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ffafbd3543c15100be96"}, "issue_id": 7116, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7123592", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7116#issuecomment-7123592", "updated_at": "2012-07-20T06:51:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TildeWill/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TildeWill/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TildeWill/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TildeWill/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TildeWill", "login": "TildeWill", "gravatar_id": "c4441c6faae71a7b1c035b85ed2c2701", "html_url": "https://github.com/TildeWill", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TildeWill/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TildeWill/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TildeWill/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c4441c6faae71a7b1c035b85ed2c2701?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6b423697c9ceefa9d8b2d65826040a2e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TildeWill/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 163532, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TildeWill/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-20T06:51:28Z", "id": 7123592, "owner": "rails"}
