There are also ways to get around the third point about caching, but at a cost of increased complexity to your system.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012133"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3177353", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3177353", "updated_at": "2011-12-16T13:53:57Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly", "login": "mikekelly", "gravatar_id": "fddf4e0508e0ab09171063fc13062b85", "html_url": "https://github.com/mikekelly", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/fddf4e0508e0ab09171063fc13062b85?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F425fbd8cd12d7ed14264bdd50d8da0b1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 55782, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mikekelly/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-16T13:53:22Z", "id": 3177353, "owner": "rails"}
