First, the name is misleading. It does not only check if it a class name, but it also checks if the class exists. Second, the next thing you would like to do after calling this method is likely to get this class itself, so this means we would constantize at least twice. One `in is_a_class_name?` and another in `constantize` to get the class. With all that in mind, I would rather provide a method called `safe_constantize` that tries to `constantize` a class and if it does not exist, it returns nil. Avoiding the need to call both `is_a_class_name?` and `constantize`.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383ac6bd3543c151010202"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3098#issuecomment-2165664"}
