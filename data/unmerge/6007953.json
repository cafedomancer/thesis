I agree with you that it'd break for a mix of objects and fixnums/strings, but it's a corner use case in my opinion, so it's probably fine (and would break in `destroy` as well).\n\n@frodsan thanks for your patch, but I'm unsure this should be backported to 3-2. Lets stick with master for now. \n\nThanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "523806b5bd3543c15100c9b2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6547#issuecomment-6007953"}
