{"body": "@dmathieu this was merged in master to match the functionality provided by `destroy`, that accepts fixnums/strings as arguments and does a find with them in this case. I agree with you that it'd break for a mix of objects and fixnums/strings, but it's a corner use case in my opinion, so it's probably fine (and would break in `destroy` as well).\n\n@frodsan thanks for your patch, but I'm unsure this should be backported to 3-2. Lets stick with master for now. \n\nThanks!", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6007953", "created_at": "2012-05-30T12:01:25Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6547#issuecomment-6007953", "updated_at": "2012-05-30T12:01:25Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6547, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "type": "User", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523806b5bd3543c15100c9b2"}, "id": 6007953, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6547"}
