I could not do it. \r\nSo I suggest to move explain logic from parent (sqlite) to sqlite3, because it's not tested for sqlite. Also, explain doesn't work with mysql.\r\n\r\nRails hasn't any configuration to test sqlite adapter. Why Rails3 (4?) supports sqlite? May be is more correct to merge sqlite and sqlite3 adapters to support only sqlite3? The same question for mysql and mysql2. If you are agree with with ideas I'm ready to merge it.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381097bd3543c15100d6d5"}, "issue_id": 5979, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5350472", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5979#issuecomment-5350472", "updated_at": "2012-04-26T06:37:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aderyabin/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aderyabin/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aderyabin/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aderyabin/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aderyabin", "login": "aderyabin", "gravatar_id": "cebfabb19814410151c8375b798643df", "html_url": "https://github.com/aderyabin", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aderyabin/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aderyabin/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aderyabin/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/cebfabb19814410151c8375b798643df?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F18e65b5eee7fa932b048ae301974c6bc.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aderyabin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 88676, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aderyabin/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-26T06:37:37Z", "id": 5350472, "owner": "rails"}
