The benchmarks posted above are flawed in that they assume `prefixes` is always a `String`, which is not realistic. Actually `String ===` is probably more performant since it works better with Ruby VM's inline cashes (which will probably get busted whenever `prefixes` is not a `String`, so a previously cached `String#is_a?` method needs to be discarded and a new for example `Array#is_a?` method needs to be stored in).\r\n\r\nOn the other side, I almost would never use `String === thing` instead of much more readable `thing.kind_of?(String)`.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18977546", "created_at": "2013-06-05T14:05:29Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10852#issuecomment-18977546", "updated_at": "2013-06-05T14:05:29Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 10852, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/thedarkone", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/c203190318ed9534390c93d1744a6cf1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F68e4593563e1b425a7717504bca103d6.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/received_events", "gravatar_id": "c203190318ed9534390c93d1744a6cf1", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "thedarkone", "type": "User", "id": 15688, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237db2cbd3543c1510087fb"}, "id": 18977546, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10852"}
