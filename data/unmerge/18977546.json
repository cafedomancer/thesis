The benchmarks posted above are flawed in that they assume `prefixes` is always a `String`, which is not realistic. Actually `String ===` is probably more performant since it works better with Ruby VM's inline cashes (which will probably get busted whenever `prefixes` is not a `String`, so a previously cached `String#is_a?` method needs to be discarded and a new for example `Array#is_a?` method needs to be stored in).\r\n\r\nOn the other side, I almost would never use `String === thing` instead of much more readable `thing.kind_of?(String)`.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237db2cbd3543c1510087fb"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10852#issuecomment-18977546"}
