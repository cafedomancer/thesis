RFCs currently in Draft Standard status will either be promoted to Internet Standard or demoted to Proposed Standard.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, this would only alter the status of RFC-2616 for HTTP/1.1, which isn't under discussion, in no more than two years. RFC-5789 for PATCH, and the Proposed Standard tier, are unchanged.\r\n\r\n>BTW, Rails supports modern cookies and content-disposition headers which are also Proposed Standards, so there's no basis to reject PATCH just because it's a Proposed Standard.\r\n\r\nNo, but it shouldn't be used as a selling point either.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that we should reject PATCH just because it is only a Proposed Standard. I do think that we need to be _very_ clear though, since people started saying that this was to conform to the RFCs, that the RFC in question is only a Proposed Standard, and has been for a long time. The status of the RFC dramatically impacts the cost-benefit analysis. Most would readily agree that Rails should do just about anything to conform to relevant Internet Standards and that those should be the defaults, but we obviously _can't_ and _shouldn't_ conform to every Proposed Standard. \r\n\r\nThis should be evaluated without regard to the RFC.\r\n\r\n>In fact, Rails should be the framework that helps PATCH attain the Internet Standard status since Rails clearly needs PATCH in order to support non-replacing updates.\r\n\r\nIf we can do so with minimal disruption.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012107"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-2758798"}
