{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7008", "repo": "rails", "body": "@josevalim I want to keep `false` around. `false.blank?` returns true and thrown out with `reject!`. \n\nI agree the check is kind of ugly. I might be able to use something other than `reject!` and `blank?` together. I'll take another look.\n\n@dmathieu Enumerable is a good idea. I'll try that.\n\nAlso, this is a lot like `compact` but gets at nested data, removes empty strings and can be used on hashes. \n\nThanks for the feedback!
