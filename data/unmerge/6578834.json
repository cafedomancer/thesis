{"body": "Doh! Apparently a better fix for this was added to master that's threadsafe:\n\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/commit/d3071db1200e90c0533f75b967c4afb519656d00#activesupport/lib/active_support/inflector/methods.rb\n\nBut it seems it was never backported to 3.2. The fix in master works for me in 1.8.7, so I'll close this pull request and you guys can merge commit that to 3.2 if you think it's appropriate. \n\nThanks for looking at this anyway!", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6578834", "created_at": "2012-06-26T15:27:42Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6864#issuecomment-6578834", "updated_at": "2012-06-26T15:27:42Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6864, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tiegz/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tiegz/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tiegz/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tiegz", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tiegz/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tiegz", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tiegz/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f86911c918d9c3eb1644189a50d74ccb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F64eec0c3fb6b12c43f51ec9e9c773fed.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tiegz/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tiegz/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f86911c918d9c3eb1644189a50d74ccb", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tiegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tiegz", "type": "User", "id": 5054, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tiegz/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e208abd354364b900d9a8"}, "id": 6578834, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6864"}
