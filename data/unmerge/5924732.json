{"body": "@bopm Thanks for the pull request.\n\nI must admit the partial lookup rules today are ultimately fucked up. We are trying to be too smart, which means that, for anyone to actually understand how a partial is rendered, he needs to at least answer 3 or 4 questions:\n\n1) Does the partial path has a slash?\n2) Is namespaced prefix enabled? (The default is yes)\n3) Is the current controller namespaced?\n4) Is the current partial namespaced to the current controller?\n\nSince Rails 4 is coming, I would like to simplify how partials are rendered. In my opinion, we have two simple approaches:\n\n1) Make all partials by default absolute. Therefore, when you pass render :partial => \"form\", it will try to render form in `app/views`. We could force a relative lookup by prepending \"./\".\n\n2) Make all partials by default relative. Therefore, when you pass render :partial => \"posts/post\", it will try to render it relative to the current controller. You would be able to get an absolute path by prepending a \"/\".\n\nThe first alternative seems to be more disruptive to me and therefore I like 2) more. Regardless, the nice thing about any of these approaches is that the object being rendered will be able to specify if it wants a relative or absolute lookup and it is no longer intrinsic to the name.\n\nI can prepare a patch myself, but I would like some feedback before. /cc @jeremy ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5924732", "created_at": "2012-05-25T07:22:17Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6478#issuecomment-5924732", "updated_at": "2012-05-25T07:22:17Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6478, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523807c9bd3543c15100cb41"}, "id": 5924732, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6478"}
