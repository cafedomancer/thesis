We are trying to be too smart, which means that, for anyone to actually understand how a partial is rendered, he needs to at least answer 3 or 4 questions:\n\n1) Does the partial path has a slash?\n2) Is namespaced prefix enabled? (The default is yes)\n3) Is the current controller namespaced?\n4) Is the current partial namespaced to the current controller?\n\nSince Rails 4 is coming, I would like to simplify how partials are rendered. In my opinion, we have two simple approaches:\n\n1) Make all partials by default absolute. Therefore, when you pass render :partial => \"form\", it will try to render form in `app/views`. We could force a relative lookup by prepending \"./\".\n\n2) Make all partials by default relative. Therefore, when you pass render :partial => \"posts/post\", it will try to render it relative to the current controller. You would be able to get an absolute path by prepending a \"/\".\n\nThe first alternative seems to be more disruptive to me and therefore I like 2) more. Regardless, the nice thing about any of these approaches is that the object being rendered will be able to specify if it wants a relative or absolute lookup and it is no longer intrinsic to the name.\n\nI can prepare a patch myself, but I would like some feedback before. /cc @jeremy ", "_id": {"$oid": "523807c9bd3543c15100cb41"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6478#issuecomment-5924732"}
