I understand that.\r\n\r\nYou, and the other rails-core guys, are leaders in our field and owners of a fantastic web framework, many including myself would say it's the best web framework. Part of being a great leader is realizing when you're wrong. It's natural to be defensive and it's fine to argue every counterpoint. And you're right about many of them.
