{"body": "Hey, thanks, but as discussed in #1969 we want to wait until after 3.1.0 to put this in the 3-1-stable branch, as it is not serious enough to risk destabilising the release. That's why I put the milestone as 3.1.1. Feel free to backport it later on :)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1665927", "created_at": "2011-07-27T17:45:17Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2306#issuecomment-1665927", "updated_at": "2011-07-27T17:45:17Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 2306, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jonleighton", "type": "User", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52384500bd3543c151010da4"}, "id": 1665927, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2306"}
