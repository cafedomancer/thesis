The current pull request however is not equivalent, because it will require the password field on all changes (since password is a virtual attribute), while today's code requires it basically on creation (for all the other changes, the password_digest will already be set).\r\n\r\nSo the ideal fix is: make the current validation strict and validate for password on creation (as this pull request). This would raise an error when the field is unintentionally empty and require a password on creation. Having the same effect the code has today, but with a nice error message.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you don't want to validate in the first place, you will have to workaround (as you just said). For that, we would need another option to turn off such validations.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380cd0bd3543c15100d20d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6185#issuecomment-5548839"}
