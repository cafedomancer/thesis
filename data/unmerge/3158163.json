Well, because it is not in the RFC right? And if someone proposed MOVE we wouldn't accept it on the ground of not being there.\r\n\r\nSo let's accept this has to be discussed taking RFCs into account, and let's accept RFCs are not axiomatic systems and are subject to interpretation in some spots.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, if verb V is not clearly justified I see no point in hiding it behind a flag, as I said above. If the need for verb V is debatable it should not be in core.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012128"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3158163", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3158163", "updated_at": "2011-12-15T08:19:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-15T08:16:32Z", "id": 3158163, "owner": "rails"}
