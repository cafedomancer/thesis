Will it return nil or the default?\r\n\r\nOther than that, it seems fine, except I have a slight concern about the growth of scope of the delegation to the point where it just recreates a manually defined method. For example, your default value may require to use an instance attribute or call an instance method, so now we're into lambda territory (`default: -> { ... }`). There is a point at which it's just easier to define a method manually and handle all the logic there.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d05bbd3543c151007c96"}, "issue_id": 11908, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/22741201", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11908#issuecomment-22741201", "updated_at": "2013-08-16T00:49:35Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg", "login": "egilburg", "gravatar_id": "cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6", "html_url": "https://github.com/egilburg", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F552d65b6e9616642fd0217dc7f8361bd.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 242532, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-08-16T00:46:15Z", "id": 22741201, "owner": "rails"}
