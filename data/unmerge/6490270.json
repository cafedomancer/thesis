{"body": "Here is my opinion on whether Rails should enable threadsafe! by default. A lot of new Rails applications will look for cheap hosting, usually a VPS. And they usually price their plans by amount of available RAM.\n\nA threaded server will take much less RAM to serve 10 concurrent requests than any multi-process server, like Unicorn or Passenger.\n\nSo it would be way cheaper to deploy default new Rails applications in low-cost VPS. It is likely that newcomers to Rails are the ones that we should be most concerned about when dealing with default values as experienced Rails developers already know about the implications of each of those settings for each environment.\n\nAllowing newcomers to Rails to deploy their apps in a cheaper VPS would be a great feature for Rails 4.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6490270", "created_at": "2012-06-21T18:16:13Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6490270", "updated_at": "2012-06-21T18:16:24Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6685, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/rosenfeld", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2abdb50caf0dc5b510330f68b02db8e4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c3aa93f86af77d8b1071d5fd2b4c91a.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2abdb50caf0dc5b510330f68b02db8e4", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "rosenfeld", "type": "User", "id": 32246, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c71c"}, "id": 6490270, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6685"}
