The two cases this patch adresses violate this rule.\r\n\r\nSecond, this patch makes `number_to_human` more user-friendly in what I would imagine is a relatively common use case. Namely, cases in which  one wants to display the number unaltered up to a certain value, and then abbreviate the number for bigger values. An example of such a case might be the display of follower and following numbers in a social app.\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, this use case requires something like: \r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nif @follower_count < 1000\r\n  @follower_count.to_s\r\nelse\r\n  number_to_human(@follower_count, :precision => 2,\r\n    :units => {:thousand => 'k', :million => 'M'})\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this patch, on the other hand, one can remove the if-clause altogether.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237eac6bd3543c151009a6a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9311#issuecomment-13700919"}
