The two cases this patch adresses violate this rule.\r\n\r\nSecond, this patch makes `number_to_human` more user-friendly in what I would imagine is a relatively common use case. Namely, cases in which  one wants to display the number unaltered up to a certain value, and then abbreviate the number for bigger values. An example of such a case might be the display of follower and following numbers in a social app.\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, this use case requires something like: \r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nif @follower_count < 1000\r\n  @follower_count.to_s\r\nelse\r\n  number_to_human(@follower_count, :precision => 2,\r\n    :units => {:thousand => 'k', :million => 'M'})\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this patch, on the other hand, one can remove the if-clause altogether.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237eac6bd3543c151009a6a"}, "issue_id": 9311, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13700919", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9311#issuecomment-13700919", "updated_at": "2013-02-18T00:17:00Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hoffm/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hoffm/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hoffm/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hoffm/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hoffm", "login": "hoffm", "gravatar_id": "f53511706f3482c13dacadf4e0806ab2", "html_url": "https://github.com/hoffm", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hoffm/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hoffm/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hoffm/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f53511706f3482c13dacadf4e0806ab2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F1abfff32ab2c9112e6e7e00d9958fb1e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hoffm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 865076, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hoffm/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-18T00:17:00Z", "id": 13700919, "owner": "rails"}
