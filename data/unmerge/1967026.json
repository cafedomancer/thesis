Your (Damien's) solution was breaking _false_ values and empty values passed as _string_. I wanted only to change behavior of _arrays_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I don't know if it's consistent to have behavior like this after mine patch:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncontent_tag(:p, \"foo\", :class => [])\r\n#=> <p>foo</p>\r\ncontent_tag(:p, \"foo\", :class => \"\")\r\n#=> <p class=\"\">foo</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, I don't know if setting empty class attribute makes sense at all. Can somebody explain?\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52383fbebd3543c15101075e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2792#issuecomment-1967026"}
