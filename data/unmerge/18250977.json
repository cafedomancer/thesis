However, my main intend is to remove the `respond_to?` call and move stuff into `Validator` itself. While this simplifies the `Validator` interface it is also preparing some more changes I'd like to push (especially simplifying `UniquenessValidator` in AR).\r\n\r\nAre you worried about the change? Is it because the options contain a `:class` now (I don't like it either)? It shouldn't break existing code?!\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dc3cbd3543c15100897e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10716#issuecomment-18250977"}
