However, my main intend is to remove the `respond_to?` call and move stuff into `Validator` itself. While this simplifies the `Validator` interface it is also preparing some more changes I'd like to push (especially simplifying `UniquenessValidator` in AR).\r\n\r\nAre you worried about the change? Is it because the options contain a `:class` now (I don't like it either)? It shouldn't break existing code?!\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18250977", "created_at": "2013-05-22T00:44:03Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10716#issuecomment-18250977", "updated_at": "2013-05-22T00:44:03Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 10716, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/apotonick", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/0fe13386ba69a128e9fadc19ae9d96be?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fda97f65bd113e490a5fab20c4a69f586.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/received_events", "gravatar_id": "0fe13386ba69a128e9fadc19ae9d96be", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "apotonick", "type": "User", "id": 10406, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apotonick/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dc3cbd3543c15100897e"}, "id": 18250977, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10716"}
