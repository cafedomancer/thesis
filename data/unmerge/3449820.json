{"body": "I think it's really unfortunate that currently on Linux systems `rails new` gets you an app that results in an error message, rather than a working app. Pre-asset-pipeline, `rails new` (or 2.x `rails app_name`) always got you an app that would boot (thanks to sqlite3, among other things). \r\n\r\nIt's really unfortunate that this is no longer true, and is definitely a poor and discouraging experience for newbies -- the error message does not keep it from being so. \r\n\r\nI'd agree that the 'right' way to handle this would be to make 'execjs' a dependency of railties, and then have the generator use execjs's own logic to determine if a ruby runtime is avail, rather than duplicating execjs logic in Rails generator. (`ExecJS::Runtimes.autodetect` and rescue RuntimeUnavailable). \r\n\r\nexecjs is a pretty small and pure ruby gem, it doesn't seem that bad to add it as a dependency. \r\n\r\nThe 'expert' user can install node.js on their system, and then execjs will detect it and therubyracer will never be added to their Gemfile.  But for non-expert/newbie users, things should Just Work, even at the cost of a longer 'bundle install' to build therubyracer.
