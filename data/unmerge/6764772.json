If A requires B and B requires C and A needs C, then A still requires C. That's just a standard practice in Ruby libs. You do not rely on what other files depend on.\n\nSo, if the code works it is by accident and may depend on the order of execution, in that sense I think @kennyj patch follows the way we do things today.\n\nUnless you have a hub with common stuff like @josevalim suggests which plays exactly that role. Loading common dependencies in an entry point. We should be still as fine-grained (because Rails allows users to load a bare Active Support and we make the documented compromise that the framework uses only what it needs). But provided that, a file where we extract libs used in a lot of places would be handy I think.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238017ebd3543c15100c150"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6964#issuecomment-6764772"}
