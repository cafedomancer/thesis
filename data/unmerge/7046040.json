{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7075", "repo": "rails", "body": "My first idea when implementing was to make it works just like full_messages but with a hash instead of an array as a return by default, and with an array when passing full as true. When calling it without parameters, a hash is necessary to associate the error messages to each attribute, but with the attribute on the message, this isn't necessary, so an array is returned.\n\nThis way, we would have:\n\n```ruby\nerrors.unique_messages\n{ :name => \"is invalid and can't be blank\",  :email => \"is invalid\"}\nerrors.unique_messages[:name]\n\"is invalid and can't be blank\"\nerrors.unique_messages(true)\n[ \"name is invalid and can't be blank\",  \"email is invalid\"]\n```\n\nI think the same as to be poor. But i was just following the full_messages method. :bowtie:\n\nThat helper was just an example to explain what i mean. Was not to match exactly the implementation. Sorry if i didn't make it clear enough.\n\nI will look into the another tips further. \n\nFinally, Thank you. I didn't know of the method to_sentence yet. =D", "_id": {"$oid": "52380010bd3543c15100bf21"}, "issue_id": 7075, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7046040", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7075#issuecomment-7046040", "updated_at": "2012-07-17T19:07:43Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/plribeiro3000/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/plribeiro3000/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/plribeiro3000/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/plribeiro3000/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/plribeiro3000", "login": "plribeiro3000", "gravatar_id": "4b897719c13e333a89392b9360868761", "html_url": "https://github.com/plribeiro3000", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/plribeiro3000/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/plribeiro3000/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/plribeiro3000/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/4b897719c13e333a89392b9360868761?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff2604cebdcfe49a9b96142a4fc0dceb1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/plribeiro3000/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 672952, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/plribeiro3000/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-17T19:07:43Z", "id": 7046040, "owner": "rails"}
