People using RJS today will be using that configuration option in 3.1. It is not exactly deprecated.\r\n\r\nThe switch to jQuery and the extraction of Prototype and RJS are important known changes in 3.1. You need to be aware of them if you're upgrading an application. In particular, if you're not using Prototype you need to remove that line.\r\n\r\nThanks for the pull request anyway.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384658bd3543c151010ef9"}, "issue_id": 2223, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1639280", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2223#issuecomment-1639280", "updated_at": "2011-07-24T00:10:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-07-24T00:10:23Z", "id": 1639280, "owner": "rails"}
