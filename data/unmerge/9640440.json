{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7835", "repo": "rails", "body": "@jeremy : Thanks for letting me know...\r\nRegarding `:customary` I think googling it is mostly necessary for users that do not speak english natively. Assuming that [this](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/customary) is natural association for you, I think `:customary` makes sense enough. But the issues is not important to me...\r\n\r\nRegarding the `ActiveSupport.default_size_prefix`: I dislike this name too... As I explained in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7835#issuecomment-9152398 The name was derived from the helper method name (`number_to_human_size`) , which I also doesn't feel is a very good description of the functionality/responsibility, but I was focusing at one thing at a time.\r\n\r\nRegarding the design/complexity: Maybe a Red-Green-Refactor approach should be taken: This PR contains the Red step (introducing tests) and the Green step (introducing the implementaiton), but not the Refactor step. Refactoring the implementation could be done in other Pull Requests, or just straight commits (for those who have commit privileges). Then it would also be clear which functionality (API) is _changed_ seperately from which functionality (API) is _extended_ (which is done in this PR).\r\n\r\nBTW: Where is this discussion taking place: some mailing-list or IRC?\r\n\r\nAnyway I will probably be happy with whatever you come up with. It just wasn't visible to me that the PR was under discussion.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f879bd3543c15100b2ac"}, "issue_id": 7835, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9640440", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7835#issuecomment-9640440", "updated_at": "2012-10-21T07:25:43Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk", "login": "jarl-dk", "gravatar_id": "968fba3ba6e5df2df68a458218be7104", "html_url": "https://github.com/jarl-dk", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/968fba3ba6e5df2df68a458218be7104?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd0cac2a26433f3f23b23854cd7d9215e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 191521, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jarl-dk/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-21T07:25:43Z", "id": 9640440, "owner": "rails"}
