So it seems like a good time to introduce both, you think?\r\n\r\nIn terms of app upgrade flow, you'd have a flag that basically excepts both forms of cookies, the current signature and these new signed name and expires values. You'd maybe keep that flipped for a month in production while peoples cookies are getting upgraded then flip it over to the \"more secure\" default when you're ready. Green field apps can do this out of the box.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d81cbd3543c15100845b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11168#issuecomment-20938874"}
