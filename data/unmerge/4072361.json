{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/4899", "repo": "rails", "body": "Except by the `entry && !entry.expired?` change, the other changes do not bring any improvement to the framework. I am not going into the discussion which one is more readable, but those changes are basically aesthetics and we avoid doing mostly aesthetic changes in the code base.\r\n\r\nWhy? Such changes only makes the history dirty (if we have to blame the code, we have to pass through layers of aesthetics changes) and moves our focus away from the important issues. We have currently 230 open pull requests, many of them representing bug fixes, so we prefer and ask developers to avoid changing aesthetics changes to the code base so we can focus on the important ones.\r\n\r\nThat said, I will accept a pull request for `entry && !entry.expired?`, but please avoid send aesthetics/code readability changes to the codebase.
