We may have to consider overriding `Time.at` to convert TWZ values first before calling `super`.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/time.c#L2553-L2559\r\n[2]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/time.c#L1815\r\n[3]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/error.c#L430-L437\r\n[4]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/error.c#L433\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dc76bd3543c1510089cf"}, "issue_id": 10686, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18446158", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10686#issuecomment-18446158", "updated_at": "2013-05-25T12:09:39Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-05-25T12:09:39Z", "id": 18446158, "owner": "rails"}
