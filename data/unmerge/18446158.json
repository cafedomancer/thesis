We may have to consider overriding `Time.at` to convert TWZ values first before calling `super`.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/time.c#L2553-L2559\r\n[2]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/time.c#L1815\r\n[3]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/error.c#L430-L437\r\n[4]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/error.c#L433\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dc76bd3543c1510089cf"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10686#issuecomment-18446158"}
