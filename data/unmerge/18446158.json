{"body": "Ugh, it looks as though `Time.at` [checks the type][1] of the first argument to see [if it's a][2] `Time` value and converts it if it does, however [the type check][3] explicitly checks that [it's not a subclass][4] of `Time`.\r\n\r\nJust blindly adding `to_int` isn't really the answer as it's saying that TWZ values can be treated like integers all of the time and may have consequences elsewhere. We may have to consider overriding `Time.at` to convert TWZ values first before calling `super`.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/time.c#L2553-L2559\r\n[2]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/time.c#L1815\r\n[3]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/error.c#L430-L437\r\n[4]: https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/v1_9_3_429/error.c#L433\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/18446158", "created_at": "2013-05-25T12:09:39Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10686#issuecomment-18446158", "updated_at": "2013-05-25T12:09:39Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 10686, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "pixeltrix", "type": "User", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dc76bd3543c1510089cf"}, "id": 18446158, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10686"}
