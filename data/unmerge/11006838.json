If you want to get an accurate assessment of time that it would take to encrypt a password, you'd ideally run `BCrypt::Engine.calibrate` on the server(s) which are intended to do the processing. An even more accurate assessment would be doing that also under the expected load. Neither of these would give precision accuracy, as far as I can, but rather a good estimate of what the cost factor should be.\r\n\r\nI agree with @jeremy that setting the #cost to a primitive type (Integer) does not adequately describe to the developer what that cost value is doing. It needs to be more intention-revealing while still allowing the developer to set the #cost to a value that makes sense for the given application. \r\n\r\nThis is why I want to do this through a Gem first so I can try different approaches while not taking time away from Rails-Core members who are probably trying to get things in order to ship Rails 4.
