I check if these objects have been garbage collected using a uuid in AR.\r\n\r\nI've made a particularly simple benchmark and tested AR speed inside of transactions with the speed using the current implementation in ruby 1.9.3: https://gist.github.com/4617394. It seems that speed of both are comparable, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on different benchmarks because I don't think I necessarily choose a good one.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ed5ebd3543c151009e0b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9044#issuecomment-12635788"}
