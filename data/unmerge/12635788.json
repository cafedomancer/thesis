{"body": "I removed the use of ObjectSpace.each_object and instead am using ObjectSpace._id2ref () so that I'm no longer iterating over all objects, but just pulling the objects out with object_ids which are associated with the transaction. I check if these objects have been garbage collected using a uuid in AR.\r\n\r\nI've made a particularly simple benchmark and tested AR speed inside of transactions with the speed using the current implementation in ruby 1.9.3: https://gist.github.com/4617394. It seems that speed of both are comparable, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on different benchmarks because I don't think I necessarily choose a good one.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12635788", "created_at": "2013-01-24T03:42:12Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9044#issuecomment-12635788", "updated_at": "2013-01-24T03:42:12Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9044, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/wangjohn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "wangjohn", "type": "User", "id": 1075780, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ed5ebd3543c151009e0b"}, "id": 12635788, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9044"}
