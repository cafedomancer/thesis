I check if these objects have been garbage collected using a uuid in AR.\r\n\r\nI've made a particularly simple benchmark and tested AR speed inside of transactions with the speed using the current implementation in ruby 1.9.3: https://gist.github.com/4617394. It seems that speed of both are comparable, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on different benchmarks because I don't think I necessarily choose a good one.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ed5ebd3543c151009e0b"}, "issue_id": 9044, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12635788", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9044#issuecomment-12635788", "updated_at": "2013-01-24T03:42:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn", "login": "wangjohn", "gravatar_id": "ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab", "html_url": "https://github.com/wangjohn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ddbca6015f428461aa5ed3b5f0fb74ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f072cda8c91e247b8dd76fa1b10a64e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1075780, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wangjohn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-24T03:42:12Z", "id": 12635788, "owner": "rails"}
