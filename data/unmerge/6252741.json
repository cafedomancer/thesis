The solutions provided so far moves all the logic into the resolver, while I think it should be handled by the underlying data structure.\n\nEDIT: removed possible solutions because they were redundant", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c6ed"}, "issue_id": 6685, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6252741", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6252741", "updated_at": "2012-06-11T19:12:06Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-11T18:53:47Z", "id": 6252741, "owner": "rails"}
