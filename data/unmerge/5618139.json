This options is to use together other conditions, like:\r\n\r\n```Model.where(:field1 => \"value\", :field2 => :not_nil)```\r\n\r\n@jeremy I agree with you to be careful with special magic values, but I didn't find a better way to do this. I prefer to use Arel syntax, like:\r\n\r\n```Model.where(:field => not_eq(nil)```\r\n\r\nOr, as you said at #5950 issues, turn ```where``` chainable and apply something like:\r\n\r\n```Model.where.not_eq(field: nil)```\r\n\r\nHowever, do your best for Rails!", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c0dbd3543c15100e489"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5160#issuecomment-5618139"}
