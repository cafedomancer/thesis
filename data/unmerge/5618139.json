{"body": "@jeremyf @jeremy @tenderlove \r\n\r\n```where_not``` is a amazing feature, but it will negate all conditions, right? This options is to use together other conditions, like:\r\n\r\n```Model.where(:field1 => \"value\", :field2 => :not_nil)```\r\n\r\n@jeremy I agree with you to be careful with special magic values, but I didn't find a better way to do this. I prefer to use Arel syntax, like:\r\n\r\n```Model.where(:field => not_eq(nil)```\r\n\r\nOr, as you said at #5950 issues, turn ```where``` chainable and apply something like:\r\n\r\n```Model.where.not_eq(field: nil)```\r\n\r\nHowever, do your best for Rails!", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5618139", "created_at": "2012-05-10T04:52:42Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5160#issuecomment-5618139", "updated_at": "2012-05-10T04:57:44Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5160, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tinogomes/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tinogomes/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tinogomes/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tinogomes", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tinogomes/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tinogomes", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tinogomes/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/9742692d8f4eb9997301de35395e5460?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F90e69a6d2ad189b222ac1998abe63aea.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tinogomes/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tinogomes/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9742692d8f4eb9997301de35395e5460", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tinogomes/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tinogomes", "type": "User", "id": 6305, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tinogomes/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c0dbd3543c15100e489"}, "id": 5618139, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5160"}
