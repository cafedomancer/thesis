Of course you're right about instance_eval, that's definitely unnecessary. I'll also remove the changes to callbacks.rb. Are you guys okay with the change to Gemfile? I wasn't sure if there was a particular reason for using http over git but git blame didn't show any. I'll make the changes and request another pull.", "_id": {"$oid": "523817f8bd3543c15100dfee"}, "issue_id": 5444, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4521464", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5444#issuecomment-4521464", "updated_at": "2012-03-15T15:09:39Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru", "login": "luke-gru", "gravatar_id": "349d851184514340f1757f3a71b6807a", "html_url": "https://github.com/luke-gru", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/349d851184514340f1757f3a71b6807a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa7e1d7d3049ac5512f00c12e92dae760.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 500554, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-15T15:08:29Z", "id": 4521464, "owner": "rails"}
