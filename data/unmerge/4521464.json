Of course you're right about instance_eval, that's definitely unnecessary. I'll also remove the changes to callbacks.rb. Are you guys okay with the change to Gemfile? I wasn't sure if there was a particular reason for using http over git but git blame didn't show any. I'll make the changes and request another pull.", "_id": {"$oid": "523817f8bd3543c15100dfee"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5444#issuecomment-4521464"}
