{"body": "> I was referring to the broken behavior of PUT in Rails, not the absence of PATCH.\r\n> \r\n> For example, caches can reasonably assume that if I `PUT {\"a\" => \"b\"}` to a resource, then that's what it should return on a `GET`. However, if the original resource was `{\"c\" => \"d\"}`, Rails would *by convention* make the resource `{\"a\" => \"b\", \"c\" => \"d\"}`, not the expected `{\"a\" => \"b\"}`.\r\n\r\nMy point is that I don't believe nobody actually relies on that. And I don't believe anybody will soon just because there is a PATCH verb now.\r\n\r\n> BTW, how did you reply to a comment?
