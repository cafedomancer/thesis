The logs showed the CSRF error and my session was being reset. I also couldn't find anywhere in the code where it checks the format and then only conditionally runs only for HTML/JS.\r\n\r\nEven the docs seem to contradict themselves. It first states:\r\n\r\n> Only HTML and JavaScript requests are checked, so this will not protect your XML API\r\n\r\nThen later it states\r\n\r\n> It's important to remember that XML or JSON requests are also affected\r\n\r\nWhy does it seem bad? It's easy enough to disable CSRF checks for API developers that don't feel it's a necessary step.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ea3ebd3543c151009977"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9405#issuecomment-14023934"}
