I would like to spend some time making this approach less hazardous, so that if an error is introduced it will fall back on static files by default. I can ensure the original error is presented and not masked by this dynamic page. I believe this will be a good balance between advanced functionality and protection. I will close this PR for now and re-open as soon a I get a more cautious implementation. If you have anything to add, or if you disagree with this approach please let me know.\n\nThanks again for your code-review and feedback  :heart: :heart: :heart: ", "_id": {"$oid": "523dcb02bd354364b900a104"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7772#issuecomment-8948016"}
