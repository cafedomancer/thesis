{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7772", "repo": "rails", "body": "@josevalim @rafaelfranca @maxim thank you for your feedback, I believe this dynamic error PR needs some work. I would like to spend some time making this approach less hazardous, so that if an error is introduced it will fall back on static files by default. I can ensure the original error is presented and not masked by this dynamic page. I believe this will be a good balance between advanced functionality and protection. I will close this PR for now and re-open as soon a I get a more cautious implementation. If you have anything to add, or if you disagree with this approach please let me know.\n\nThanks again for your code-review and feedback  :heart: :heart: :heart: ", "_id": {"$oid": "523dcb02bd354364b900a104"}, "issue_id": 7772, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8948016", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7772#issuecomment-8948016", "updated_at": "2012-09-27T18:25:08Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems", "login": "schneems", "gravatar_id": "db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e", "html_url": "https://github.com/schneems", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ef42a6eab211ddd71ac423a80b42d15.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 59744, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-27T18:25:08Z", "id": 8948016, "owner": "rails"}
