If you want to turn off callbacks, you are poorly using them.\r\n\r\nI just don't understand why it's ok for ActiveRecord to give options for skipping validation, and skipping protection for attr_accessible, but it's not ok to give you an option to skip callbacks.  It seems inconsistent and inflexible.  To say \"you're poorly using them\" doesn't really seem fair.  There are a lot of instances I can think of where one might want to be able to choose to not go through the entire callback cycle-- I see can see this happening a lot via experimentation in the console.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381ff5bd3543c15100e868"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4885#issuecomment-5489712"}
