If you want to turn off callbacks, you are poorly using them.\r\n\r\nI just don't understand why it's ok for ActiveRecord to give options for skipping validation, and skipping protection for attr_accessible, but it's not ok to give you an option to skip callbacks.  It seems inconsistent and inflexible.  To say \"you're poorly using them\" doesn't really seem fair.  There are a lot of instances I can think of where one might want to be able to choose to not go through the entire callback cycle-- I see can see this happening a lot via experimentation in the console.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381ff5bd3543c15100e868"}, "issue_id": 4885, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5489712", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4885#issuecomment-5489712", "updated_at": "2012-05-03T15:06:11Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99", "login": "patrick99e99", "gravatar_id": "648553f5c693d93c9ea2e042857ad22c", "html_url": "https://github.com/patrick99e99", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/648553f5c693d93c9ea2e042857ad22c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F25b6a534a8c88b8e73fe7b865fd36bde.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 28946, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-03T15:06:11Z", "id": 5489712, "owner": "rails"}
