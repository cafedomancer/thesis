The reason is because Rails currently has broken support for HTTP as commonly understood--leading to potentially problematic interoperability with RESTful clients, caching mechanisms, and proxies.\r\n\r\n> Do you have anything to support this? PATCH is a new verb in the specs, so I doubt proxies and caching mechanisms went crazy to support it and change PUT behavior.\r\n\r\nI was referring to the broken behavior of PUT in Rails, not the absence of PATCH.\r\n\r\nFor example, caches can reasonably assume that if I `PUT {\"a\" => \"b\"}` to a resource, then that's what it should return on a `GET`. However, if the original resource was `{\"c\" => \"d\"}`, Rails would *by convention* make the resource `{\"a\" => \"b\", \"c\" => \"d\"}`, not the expected `{\"a\" => \"b\"}`.\r\n\r\nBTW, how did you reply to a comment?
