I would prefer this, as until I get a better explanation of its\nvalue and an easier-to-understand RFC, I don't want this to be in the docs.\nI don't think that rails should side with a Proposed Standard that doesn't\nhave adoption from numerous web stack components (unlike the other proposed\nstandards @dlee cited, content-disposition and modern cookies) unless\nthere's a strong benefit to a number of users.\n\nIf there are technical reasons why such a plugin wouldn't work well they\ncould be addressed and the changes would likely help with other plugin\nprojects as well. Furthermore, there would be a clear path forward to\ndemonstrate the value of the PATCH behavior: integrate it with a caching\nproxy and show how it improves things vs. not having PATCH.\n\nOn Wed, Nov 16, 2011 at 3:13 PM, Michael Koziarski <\nreply@reply.github.com\n> wrote:\n\n> Supporting it as an option, with no change of defaults, circumvents all 3\n> of those objections.
