As @pixeltrix says, if you add a month to a date, and then add another month, there is going to be separate behavior as opposed to adding 2 months all at once. That's a fact. I think the two cases that were brought up -- `+ 1.month + 1.month` vs. `+ 2.months` -- are kind of moot. Dates are hard. If you have a loop and are starting from a date and incrementing it by a month every iteration, you're going to run into this issue anyway. If you're doing something like `date + 1.month + some.months` you should expect that it's going to execute `date + 1.month` before executing `+ some.months`. It doesn't *read* well, but that's what you get for trying to make your Ruby read like English :trollface:", "_id": {"$oid": "52380668bd3543c15100c8e4"}, "issue_id": 6581, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6687021", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6581#issuecomment-6687021", "updated_at": "2012-06-30T17:48:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire", "login": "mcmire", "gravatar_id": "e9e852b18079792bc5f4ec52b8e37c53", "html_url": "https://github.com/mcmire", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e9e852b18079792bc5f4ec52b8e37c53?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0d46839f6371fb84f6b6c682f5fc2c77.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 7371, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-30T17:48:37Z", "id": 6687021, "owner": "rails"}
