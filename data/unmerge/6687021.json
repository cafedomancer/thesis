As @pixeltrix says, if you add a month to a date, and then add another month, there is going to be separate behavior as opposed to adding 2 months all at once. That's a fact. I think the two cases that were brought up -- `+ 1.month + 1.month` vs. `+ 2.months` -- are kind of moot. Dates are hard. If you have a loop and are starting from a date and incrementing it by a month every iteration, you're going to run into this issue anyway. If you're doing something like `date + 1.month + some.months` you should expect that it's going to execute `date + 1.month` before executing `+ some.months`. It doesn't *read* well, but that's what you get for trying to make your Ruby read like English :trollface:", "_id": {"$oid": "52380668bd3543c15100c8e4"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6581#issuecomment-6687021"}
