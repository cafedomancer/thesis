I set this in a Rails 4 project (with the above patch applied) and everything seems to be working well.  To walk the call graph of a node I need access to Event's \"@children\", so I had to use:\n\nevent.instance_variable_get(:@children)\n\nAn \"attr_reader :children\" would be swell.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/2938578\n\nIt would be great if you landed the patch above in Rails 4, but I don't think back-porting to Rails 3 is necessary yet, at least from New Relic's perspective.  We can wait until we are at least close to having an agent that makes full use of the mechanism.\n\nThanks for you're help with this.  I'm going to continue to work on this agent prototype and will let you know if I run into any snags.\n\n-jon\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52381133bd3543c15100d792"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5932#issuecomment-6366211"}
