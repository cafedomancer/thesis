With regards to `password_digest` being blank, I don't think that is a concern anymore after the above, correct?\r\n\r\n@josevalim, @bsodmike wdyt?", "_id": {"$oid": "5238185fbd3543c15100e054"}, "issue_id": 5418, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4491932", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5418#issuecomment-4491932", "updated_at": "2012-03-14T04:15:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit", "login": "rohit", "gravatar_id": "1644b4d748356fe448fd398e2973a7ca", "html_url": "https://github.com/rohit", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/1644b4d748356fe448fd398e2973a7ca?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F907ee68e550f498a93ec82d228135c00.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 14514, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-14T04:12:26Z", "id": 4491932, "owner": "rails"}
