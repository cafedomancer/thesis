{"body": "I personally think `ActiveModel::SecurePassword` should come with the following \u2015 \r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nvalidates :password,  :presence => true, :confirmation => true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will allow this line to be removed => https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activemodel/lib/active_model/secure_password.rb#L68\r\n\r\nThe API docs should mention about the validation on `password` and `password confirmation`. With regards to `password_digest` being blank, I don't think that is a concern anymore after the above, correct?\r\n\r\n@josevalim, @bsodmike wdyt?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4491932", "created_at": "2012-03-14T04:12:26Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5418#issuecomment-4491932", "updated_at": "2012-03-14T04:15:04Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5418, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/rohit", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/1644b4d748356fe448fd398e2973a7ca?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F907ee68e550f498a93ec82d228135c00.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/received_events", "gravatar_id": "1644b4d748356fe448fd398e2973a7ca", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "rohit", "type": "User", "id": 14514, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rohit/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238185fbd3543c15100e054"}, "id": 4491932, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5418"}
