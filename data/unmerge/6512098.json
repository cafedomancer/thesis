If average response time is 50ms, a single concurrency could serve 20 requests per second. If you have 6, 120 requests per second. \"A hundred concurrent requests\" means a hundred concurrent query to the database (not considering connection pool).\n\nA connection in the database is much more serious than ruby concurrency. It takes 8MB stack space + many other per-connection buffers for each. Too many Ruby concurrency than necessary is harmful, that's my point. In my story, 6 concurrency because 6 is optimal. Beyond 6 is too many.
