{"body": "Oh, snap! You are right, if this is only for development, there is no need to worry with performance.\r\n\r\nThe second problem was about introducing a new class. I would vote to have AD::Callbacks.to_reload instead of AD::Reload.to_reload. We already have the information if we should run it in each request or not inside the middleware: https://github.com/bigfix/rails/blob/732669640c8ed4c9955bfeb8f58fa87c1631029a/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/callbacks.rb#L47\r\n\r\nOne last thing is that the \"railties/lib/rails/console/app.rb\" change is wrong. If we had AD::Callbacks and AD::Reloader, both should be called, because stuff like reloading I18n or setting observers occurs in AD::Callbacks and after your change, it won't happen again. Not your fault, as we probably don't have tests for this area (Rails 2.3 legacy :()", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/623084", "created_at": "2010-12-19T21:25:13Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/137#issuecomment-623084", "updated_at": "2010-12-19T21:25:13Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 137, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523868afbd3543c1510129ba"}, "id": 623084, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/137"}
