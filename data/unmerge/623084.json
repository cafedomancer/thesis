You are right, if this is only for development, there is no need to worry with performance.\r\n\r\nThe second problem was about introducing a new class. I would vote to have AD::Callbacks.to_reload instead of AD::Reload.to_reload. We already have the information if we should run it in each request or not inside the middleware: https://github.com/bigfix/rails/blob/732669640c8ed4c9955bfeb8f58fa87c1631029a/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/callbacks.rb#L47\r\n\r\nOne last thing is that the \"railties/lib/rails/console/app.rb\" change is wrong. If we had AD::Callbacks and AD::Reloader, both should be called, because stuff like reloading I18n or setting observers occurs in AD::Callbacks and after your change, it won't happen again. Not your fault, as we probably don't have tests for this area (Rails 2.3 legacy :()", "_id": {"$oid": "523868afbd3543c1510129ba"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/137#issuecomment-623084"}
