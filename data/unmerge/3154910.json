We can address the defaults in some far distant release once we actually have real experience with the benefits.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of bringing this to a close I'm going to close this pull request, please feel free to submit another which *only* adds a configuration option allowing users to switch on `PATCH`", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012126"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3154910", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3154910", "updated_at": "2011-12-15T00:47:31Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-15T00:47:31Z", "id": 3154910, "owner": "rails"}
