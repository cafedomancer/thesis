I would kindly ask those of you who have them to put them away and let's have a fun, no harm, technical discussion. We are the Ruby community afterall, not the PHP one.\r\n\r\nDHH and I have talked tonight on the Rails Campfire. I really appreciate the time he's spending on Rails even though he has a business to run.\r\n\r\nWe have decided that this feature should be opt-out in much the same way that ActiveRecord currently is. \r\n\r\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with this, the current way of doing this when you generate a new application to pass the `--skip-active-record` option which changes the top of `config/application.rb` from requiring `rails/all` to requiring all the railties in [`rails/all`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/all.rb) with the exception of the `active_record/railtie` file. This leaves you open to use the other ORMs that you know and love.\r\n\r\nNow, with this Sprockets change, we've discussed that it would be best to have the `sprockets-rails` gem as a dependency of the `actionpack` gem, but to have `sprockets-rails` activated when `config.assets.enabled` is set to `true`. I realise that as `sprockets-rails` would be a dependency of `actionpack` that this means that `sprockets-rails` would still be required (just like any other gem in your Gemfile or a dependency of those gems, and so on). But by using this flag we will enable the functionality provided by this gem.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it, a nice way forward that allows you to use both Sprockets and whatever you like, with Sprockets still being the \"on-by-default\" default.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384d2bbd3543c151011498"}, "issue_id": 1855, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1446822", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1855#issuecomment-1446822", "updated_at": "2011-06-27T11:58:21Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar", "login": "radar", "gravatar_id": "9a2a53db8e9b4476038c94a64b32833f", "html_url": "https://github.com/radar", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9a2a53db8e9b4476038c94a64b32833f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F573eec40e4ef4f2089531dd5cbf629f8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2687, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-27T11:58:21Z", "id": 1446822, "owner": "rails"}
