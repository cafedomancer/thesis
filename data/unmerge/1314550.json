Please give a specific example of where it's failing and I will look at it. The problem here was that AS::Dependencies was raising a misleading error - it should raise NameError instead of ArgumentError and that's what has been fixed.\r\n\r\nOne source of problems is when declaring a namespace in a single line like:\r\n\r\n    class Blog::Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n    end\r\n\r\nthis can cause problems because constant lookup behaves differently that when declaring it like this:\r\n\r\n    module Blog\r\n      class Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nAlways try and use the latter if possible and especially if you see errors like:\r\n\r\n    toplevel constant XX referenced by YY::XX\r\n\r\nI had a look at whether this could be fixed however there was no way to intercept the constant lookup.", "_id": {"$oid": "523857a2bd3543c151011b83"}, "issue_id": 1422, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1314550", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1422#issuecomment-1314550", "updated_at": "2011-06-07T09:11:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-07T09:11:51Z", "id": 1314550, "owner": "rails"}
