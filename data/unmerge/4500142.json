It's anemic for now but will grow as people find need for mass assignment security and the other ActiveRecord like methods (`attributes=`, `assign_attributes`). This is such a common piece of code that there's no reason to believe that people needing mass assignment functionality also need to support the ActiveModel API, provided by BasicModel. For example, [this presentation](http://decoupling-wrocloverb-2012.heroku.com/) repeats the code twice in classes that never interface with ActionPack.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381901bd3543c15100e101"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5384#issuecomment-4500142"}
