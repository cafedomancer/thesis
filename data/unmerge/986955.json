{"body": "@dhh - not sure if this is the right venue for a long-winded discussion of the history of RSpec's equality matchers, so maybe  I'll blog about it, but today you can say (and I find myself using) `actual.should eq(expected)` (for equivalence, i.e. ==) and `actual.should be(expected)` (for identity, i.e. equal?).\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more to say on this topic, and on the issue of test method proliferation, and I'm happy to get into it here but I'd rather find a different venue for it. Maybe you could submit a github issue to rspec-core saying something like \"what the fuck is up with should ==\" and we can not only have a great conversation about it but maybe we can get everyone tweeting about it too :)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/986955", "created_at": "2011-04-12T00:25:59Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/258#issuecomment-986955", "updated_at": "2011-04-12T00:25:59Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 258, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/dchelimsky", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d38ab152e1e3e219512a9859fcd93af?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F46072631582fc240dd2674a7d063b040.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events", "gravatar_id": "5d38ab152e1e3e219512a9859fcd93af", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "dchelimsky", "type": "User", "id": 1075, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386422bd3543c1510125c8"}, "id": 986955, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/258"}
