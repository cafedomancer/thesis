Maybe you could submit a github issue to rspec-core saying something like \"what the fuck is up with should ==\" and we can not only have a great conversation about it but maybe we can get everyone tweeting about it too :)", "_id": {"$oid": "52386422bd3543c1510125c8"}, "issue_id": 258, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/986955", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/258#issuecomment-986955", "updated_at": "2011-04-12T00:25:59Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky", "login": "dchelimsky", "gravatar_id": "5d38ab152e1e3e219512a9859fcd93af", "html_url": "https://github.com/dchelimsky", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d38ab152e1e3e219512a9859fcd93af?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F46072631582fc240dd2674a7d063b040.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1075, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dchelimsky/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-12T00:25:59Z", "id": 986955, "owner": "rails"}
