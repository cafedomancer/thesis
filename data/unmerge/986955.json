Maybe you could submit a github issue to rspec-core saying something like \"what the fuck is up with should ==\" and we can not only have a great conversation about it but maybe we can get everyone tweeting about it too :)", "_id": {"$oid": "52386422bd3543c1510125c8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/258#issuecomment-986955"}
