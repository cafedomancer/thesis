{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7889", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thats fair, I agree that there is a lot going on with regards to options helpers.  I saw that old ticket and have no problem incorporating my changes into grouped_options_for_select.\r\n\r\nOn the flip-side, the mixed_options_for_select method would take any array (designed with just options for options_for_select, or optgroups for grouped_options_for_select) and return the right output.\r\n\r\nEither way, I support simplifying/consolidating the option helpers here and cleaning up/optimizing the code.  Also, as a relatively new developer to RoR, I'll accept any help/advice/suggestions.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7e6bd3543c15100b15b"}, "issue_id": 7889, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9312121", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7889#issuecomment-9312121", "updated_at": "2012-10-10T17:29:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chatura-atapattu/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chatura-atapattu/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chatura-atapattu/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chatura-atapattu/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chatura-atapattu", "login": "chatura-atapattu", "gravatar_id": "341131caf7911c0047602e3b9c272b62", "html_url": "https://github.com/chatura-atapattu", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chatura-atapattu/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chatura-atapattu/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chatura-atapattu/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/341131caf7911c0047602e3b9c272b62?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F00ee7845366bf7e25447bbd96dc7b327.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chatura-atapattu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 942312, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chatura-atapattu/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-10T17:29:51Z", "id": 9312121, "owner": "rails"}
