{"body": "Thats fair, I agree that there is a lot going on with regards to options helpers.  I saw that old ticket and have no problem incorporating my changes into grouped_options_for_select.\r\n\r\nOn the flip-side, the mixed_options_for_select method would take any array (designed with just options for options_for_select, or optgroups for grouped_options_for_select) and return the right output.\r\n\r\nEither way, I support simplifying/consolidating the option helpers here and cleaning up/optimizing the code.
