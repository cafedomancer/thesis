I saw that old ticket and have no problem incorporating my changes into grouped_options_for_select.\r\n\r\nOn the flip-side, the mixed_options_for_select method would take any array (designed with just options for options_for_select, or optgroups for grouped_options_for_select) and return the right output.\r\n\r\nEither way, I support simplifying/consolidating the option helpers here and cleaning up/optimizing the code.  Also, as a relatively new developer to RoR, I'll accept any help/advice/suggestions.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7e6bd3543c15100b15b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7889#issuecomment-9312121"}
