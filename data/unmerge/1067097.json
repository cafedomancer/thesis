{"body": "I just force pushed a rewritten version of this that's inline with the API that dhh suggested.  The relavent commit is [here](https://github.com/myronmarston/rails/commit/adb6ca31df847b682f258c9c8e402faf117cb61c).\r\n\r\nThere are a few edge cases that we need to iron out of the API.  Given the following models and observers:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass ORM\r\n  include ActiveModel::Observing\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Widget < ORM; end\r\nclass Budget < ORM; end\r\nclass WidgetObserver < ActiveModel::Observer; end\r\nclass BudgetObserver < ActiveModel::Observer; end\r\nclass AuditTrail < ActiveModel::Observer\r\n  observe :widget, :budget\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n...how would you expect the following cases to work?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nWidget.observers.disable :all\r\n\r\n# ...later\r\nORM.observers.enable :all\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould `WidgetObserver` and `AuditTrail` receive notifications for a `Widget`?  We've disabled them directly on `Widget`, but enabled _all_ observers on `ORM` at a later point.  It's a bit ambiguous what the behavior should be.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n\r\nBudget.observers.enable :audit_trail\r\n\r\n# ...later\r\nORM.observers.disable :audit_trail\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, it's a bit ambiguous: should `AuditTrail` receive notifications for a `Budget` or not?\r\n\r\nBeing able to enable/disable observers at different levels of the model class hierarchy sounds nifty in practice, but I'm concerned about these edge cases where there isn't a clear right answer (to me anyway).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1067097", "created_at": "2011-04-27T22:36:21Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/250#issuecomment-1067097", "updated_at": "2011-04-27T22:36:21Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 250, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/myronmarston", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/42d4590355a1404230fbc9aff4dd377b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6916222172eb021e5d5f0043453078b9.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/received_events", "gravatar_id": "42d4590355a1404230fbc9aff4dd377b", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "myronmarston", "type": "User", "id": 49391, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/myronmarston/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386459bd3543c15101261b"}, "id": 1067097, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/250"}
