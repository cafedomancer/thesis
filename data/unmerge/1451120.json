In short, my brief glance leads me to believe that moving the `rails` gems' dependencies (ie., the dependencies on ActiveRecord, ActionMailer, etc) out of `rails.gemspec` into application `Gemfile`s would have no ill effect and would require a very minimal change.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384d2bbd3543c15101149f"}, "issue_id": 1855, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1451120", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1855#issuecomment-1451120", "updated_at": "2011-06-27T23:04:06Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel", "login": "emmanuel", "gravatar_id": "83611ed7f7ed587603fbdffc691ea989", "html_url": "https://github.com/emmanuel", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/83611ed7f7ed587603fbdffc691ea989?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F82674fc29bc0d9895cee346548c2cb5c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 7657, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/emmanuel/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-27T23:04:06Z", "id": 1451120, "owner": "rails"}
