And some existing extensions may be counterexamples.\r\n\r\nBut as I said it is a rule of thumb. A rule of thumb that helps keeping AS core extensions under control, otherwise AS would evolve into facets which is definitely not the goal.\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of extensions that could be useful theoretically, but didn't fit in the criteria for being in AS. I believe this proposal falls here.
