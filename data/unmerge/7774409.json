{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7360", "repo": "rails", "body": "I paired on the original implementation of the divider and had the desire to add the divider to rails in the first place, I can say with certainty that the original implementors did not intend to have the divider_on_first in the first place.\n\nIt was something I expected rails to already do when I had to add a option group to a select on my project, so I was surprised when rails did not already have it. My app's implementation generated a collection without the divider_on_first, but our first patch unfortunately was incorrect.\n\nI think divider is simple and self evident as to outcome. If it gets more complicated I agree we should not try to put up with that complexity in rails. Personally I more frequently use dividers, I rarely put real human readable labels on grouped options and more often than not use the label as a divider. If anything, consider also removing the ability to label grouped options as you could easily generate your own markup for that.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fcc5bd3543c15100ba24"}, "issue_id": 7360, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7774409", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7360#issuecomment-7774409", "updated_at": "2012-08-16T00:58:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evanfarrar/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evanfarrar/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evanfarrar/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evanfarrar/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/evanfarrar", "login": "evanfarrar", "gravatar_id": "bb4976df206152ce93aad43f1eb8faa0", "html_url": "https://github.com/evanfarrar", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evanfarrar/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evanfarrar/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evanfarrar/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/bb4976df206152ce93aad43f1eb8faa0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd4a93297083a23cc099f7bd6a8621131.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evanfarrar/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 7092, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/evanfarrar/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-16T00:58:20Z", "id": 7774409, "owner": "rails"}
