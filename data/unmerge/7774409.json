My app's implementation generated a collection without the divider_on_first, but our first patch unfortunately was incorrect.\n\nI think divider is simple and self evident as to outcome. If it gets more complicated I agree we should not try to put up with that complexity in rails. Personally I more frequently use dividers, I rarely put real human readable labels on grouped options and more often than not use the label as a divider. If anything, consider also removing the ability to label grouped options as you could easily generate your own markup for that.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fcc5bd3543c15100ba24"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7360#issuecomment-7774409"}
