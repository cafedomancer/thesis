{"body": "I don't think we should mute both loggers, just one. That said, +1 for config.assets.logger but besides setting it to false, we could also configure sprockets logger through it and therefore use the same logger as Rails, but with increased severity. In other words, I am fine with changes in sprockets/railties (and they could be improved) but I don't think we should change rails/rack/logger.
