{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5379", "repo": "rails", "body": "Ok, I just got feedback from other Rails Core Members and some of them are actually interested in this feature. But we need a few changes to make everything work well. If you are up to the challenge we can work on this together, I can provide any guidance you need. Here are the concerns:\r\n\r\n1) We would need to move 500.html, 404.html and friends to app/assets so they would be able to use the digested version of the assets;\r\n\r\n2) I think development accepts both `/assets/email.png` and `/assets/DIGEST-email.png`. This is bad because if you accidentally use the non digest version in development, you will just catch the error in production;\r\n\r\nIf we can fix those two points, I believe we can change how this rake task behaves for Rails 4 to not include the non digest versions by default. If someone want the digest version, they can run `rake assets:precompile:nondigest` manually.
