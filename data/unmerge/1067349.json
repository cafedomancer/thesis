So 1 kB is 1000 bytes, but 1 KiB is 1024 bytes. People started to adopt this as early as 1998 (as per the Wikipedia article), but adoption has been slow. I think we should do one by default with an option to choose which one to use, maybe `:prefix => :binary` and `:prefix => :si`?", "_id": {"$oid": "52386324bd3543c15101247d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/292#issuecomment-1067349"}
