So 1 kB is 1000 bytes, but 1 KiB is 1024 bytes. People started to adopt this as early as 1998 (as per the Wikipedia article), but adoption has been slow. I think we should do one by default with an option to choose which one to use, maybe `:prefix => :binary` and `:prefix => :si`?", "_id": {"$oid": "52386324bd3543c15101247d"}, "issue_id": 292, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1067349", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/292#issuecomment-1067349", "updated_at": "2011-04-27T23:36:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henrikhodne/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henrikhodne/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henrikhodne/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henrikhodne/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/henrikhodne", "login": "henrikhodne", "gravatar_id": "d036be96167a38393d657c66a25ec85c", "html_url": "https://github.com/henrikhodne", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henrikhodne/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henrikhodne/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henrikhodne/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/d036be96167a38393d657c66a25ec85c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff1ab4591a72bfca2da721ca61a6e9569.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henrikhodne/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 24421, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/henrikhodne/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-27T23:36:32Z", "id": 1067349, "owner": "rails"}
