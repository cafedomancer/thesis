{"body": "@bts sure, but what for? In my story, I said 6 processes take only 360MB of RAM. A single JVM with true threaded concurrency could use even less memory while fully utilizing CPU cores. Nice, but isn't 360MB small enough already?\n\nIn the future, we'll have much more cores, like 128 in a single box, and that's when no-GIL threaded concurrency will be truly useful, in a practical sense. Will that future come next year? No. What we've been seeing instead is that servers are going all cloud and those many cores aren't fully allocated to a single Linux VM. RAM is cheaper than CPU.\n\nWith a cloud with [extremely poor CPUs](http://blog.carlmercier.com/2012/01/05/ec2-is-basically-one-big-ripoff/) the situation gets to the extreme. I've seen many setups on EC2 that there are plenty of free memory while CPU cores are pegged and load average is high.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6511311", "created_at": "2012-06-22T16:01:19Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6511311", "updated_at": "2012-06-22T16:52:03Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6685, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/kenn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f3c42aa7989a9a0c37709abc08a6327f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F20d749bc05f47d2bd3026ce457dcfd8e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f3c42aa7989a9a0c37709abc08a6327f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "kenn", "type": "User", "id": 10350, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c73c"}, "id": 6511311, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6685"}
