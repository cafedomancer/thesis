This is a huge improvement over using constants which are checked into the code repo, but still has weaknesses: it\u2019s easy to mistakenly check in a config file to the repo; there is a tendency for config files to be scattered about in different places and different formats, making it hard to see and manage all the config in one place. Further, these formats tend to be language- or framework-specific.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cf2cbd3543c151007b0c"}, "issue_id": 12075, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/23522736", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12075#issuecomment-23522736", "updated_at": "2013-08-29T20:56:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver", "login": "garysweaver", "gravatar_id": "8838005371ab9c0b1d40f0504bf8832a", "html_url": "https://github.com/garysweaver", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/8838005371ab9c0b1d40f0504bf8832a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4eb6720c6cd70ee9e67ca6e4dc12e3df.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 92330, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/garysweaver/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-08-29T20:55:32Z", "id": 23522736, "owner": "rails"}
