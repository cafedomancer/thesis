{"body": "It wasn't available because @Crunch09 hasn't run `bundle install` when using rails from a freshly cloned git repository.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happens is this: Rails relies on certain gems (`sprockets-rails`, `i18n`, `multi_json`, `arel`, `thread_safe` etc.) for its core functionality. These are listed as dependencies in Rails' various `*.gemspec` files, so whenever Rails is installed via rubygems its dependencies also get auto-installed. They are also included in the root `Gemfile`, so when you are using Rails without installing it as gem (as is in this case with a cloned git repo) a user can run `bundle` to have them automatically installed.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11641035", "created_at": "2012-12-22T20:30:37Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8589#issuecomment-11641035", "updated_at": "2012-12-22T20:30:37Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8589, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/thedarkone", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/c203190318ed9534390c93d1744a6cf1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F68e4593563e1b425a7717504bca103d6.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/received_events", "gravatar_id": "c203190318ed9534390c93d1744a6cf1", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "thedarkone", "type": "User", "id": 15688, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f1ddbd3543c15100a4f8"}, "id": 11641035, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8589"}
