These are listed as dependencies in Rails' various `*.gemspec` files, so whenever Rails is installed via rubygems its dependencies also get auto-installed. They are also included in the root `Gemfile`, so when you are using Rails without installing it as gem (as is in this case with a cloned git repo) a user can run `bundle` to have them automatically installed.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f1ddbd3543c15100a4f8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8589#issuecomment-11641035"}
