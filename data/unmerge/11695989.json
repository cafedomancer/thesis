I didn't realize :allow_nil was handled at the lower level; I agree that your version is cleaner.\r\n\r\nI noticed you changed the tests to require 1.9 for its new hash syntax.  Is there a reason to not leave them runnable in 1.8?  This changes is going to Rails 3 which I am pretty sure still supports 1.8.  I would certainly appreciate if it does--my company hasn't finished the changeover to 1.9 yet! :)\r\n\r\nAlso a co-worker pointed out that the Rails Guides currently document this inconsistency as a TIP: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations_callbacks.html (search for \"ignore\").\r\n\r\nI've made a corresponding fix to remove that TIP as it is no longer applicable:  https://github.com/lifo/docrails/pull/122 .", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f18fbd3543c15100a473"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8622#issuecomment-11695989"}
