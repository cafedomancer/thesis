Or maybe we can determine on paper if and when it fails (if it does for any literal, the problem in the example is in subtraction, not in the modulo and I would not take it to be a bug of this predicate).\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fe2cbd3543c15100bcac"}, "issue_id": 7216, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7431276", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7216#issuecomment-7431276", "updated_at": "2012-08-01T15:56:31Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-01T15:56:31Z", "id": 7431276, "owner": "rails"}
