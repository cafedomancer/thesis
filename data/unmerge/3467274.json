The idea\r\nwould be as-is on Windows and OSX, gem 'therubyracer' on everything\r\nelse?\r\n\r\nThis could make a mistake -- someone on Win or OSX might not actually\r\nhave a JS runtime that execjs can find for some odd reason. But that's\r\nneccesarily so bad a 'failure mode'.\r\n\r\nWorse, someone on linux might have node.js installed and not need\r\ntherubyracer, but the generator will add it to gemfile anyway, making\r\nthem wait through the too-lengthy bundle install and compilation for\r\nit before they even have the chance to go and remove it from their\r\nGemfile (if they're smart enough to not need it).  Which is def going\r\nto annoy some 'power users'.\r\n\r\nUsing execjs seems the RIGHT way to do it, but the cost is a\r\ndependency. Trade offs either way. Ultimately your call (or other\r\nrails core team) I think, what do you think?\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Jan 12, 2012 at 12:41 PM, Aaron Patterson\r\n<reply@reply.github.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n> Could we just do platform detection and emit \"good defaults\" depending on the platform? \u00a0That would let us avoid runtime detection.\r\n>\r\n> ---\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4407#issuecomment-3467148", "_id": {"$oid": "523826bfbd3543c15100ee0a"}, "issue_id": 4407, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3467274", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4407#issuecomment-3467274", "updated_at": "2012-01-12T17:48:44Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind", "login": "jrochkind", "gravatar_id": "6a13e655e637138f8d571cec3f9cea76", "html_url": "https://github.com/jrochkind", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/6a13e655e637138f8d571cec3f9cea76?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd54ea80e1dddb765bab019d4dfe36c23.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 149304, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrochkind/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-01-12T17:48:44Z", "id": 3467274, "owner": "rails"}
