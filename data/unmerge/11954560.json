However, as far as I can see, this rake task wasn't run in a while. README of railties and README of generated project actually differ as of now.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the \"README file created within your application\" link at http://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org points to the railties README.\r\n\r\nI don't think the README of generated project should be a guide to Rails. It should be a short Markdown file describing requirements of the project (ruby version, database, required env vars), how to bundle it, how to run tests, and how to run server. Current \"Welcome to Rails\" README may just be moved into rails' or railties' README or a GETTING_STARTED.rdoc and get linked by my API docs page.\r\n\r\n(Looks like we also should get rid of that unused rake task.)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f0d2bd3543c15100a358"}, "issue_id": 8695, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11954560", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8695#issuecomment-11954560", "updated_at": "2013-01-07T15:05:05Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goshakkk/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goshakkk/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goshakkk/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goshakkk/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/goshakkk", "login": "goshakkk", "gravatar_id": "477dc65c2083c0aea87485b399372db0", "html_url": "https://github.com/goshakkk", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goshakkk/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goshakkk/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goshakkk/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/477dc65c2083c0aea87485b399372db0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8e6fe8f267d3b31fe2e5b5da1787a120.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goshakkk/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 315596, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/goshakkk/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-07T15:03:10Z", "id": 11954560, "owner": "rails"}
