It should be a short Markdown file describing requirements of the project (ruby version, database, required env vars), how to bundle it, how to run tests, and how to run server. Current \"Welcome to Rails\" README may just be moved into rails' or railties' README or a GETTING_STARTED.rdoc and get linked by my API docs page.\r\n\r\n(Looks like we also should get rid of that unused rake task.)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f0d2bd3543c15100a358"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8695#issuecomment-11954560"}
