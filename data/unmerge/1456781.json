And for the record, thank you *very much* for undertaking the work actually referred to by this pull request. And pardon me for so doggedly pursuing the issue, especially since I didn't understand that @josevalim's solution completely resolves my concerns.\r\n\r\n@josevalim -- thank you for the great solution, and for showing me that I had completely misunderstood it. I was stuck on the idea that customizers would still need to have `gem 'rails'` in their `Gemfile`s and then break down the dependencies by replacing `rails/all` in `application.rb` (with `require 'action_pack/railtie`, `require 'action_mailer/railtie`, etc). \r\n\r\nNow I get it. Your solution is much better.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384d2bbd3543c1510114b6"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1855#issuecomment-1456781"}
