That predicate returns a true or false value depending on whether the request is Ajax. And you use it like this\n\n```ruby\nif request.xhr?\n  ...\nend\n```\n\nRuby on Rails does not document singletons in general, so even if some predicates return a singleton today, they could not tomorrow. If you totally need a singleton you need in general to `!!` the value they return.\n\nThere was a long thread in the past about this in #5329.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fad9bd3543c15100b6df"}, "issue_id": 7510, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8232611", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7510#issuecomment-8232611", "updated_at": "2012-09-03T08:42:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-03T08:41:59Z", "id": 8232611, "owner": "rails"}
