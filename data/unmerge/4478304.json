Being able to have these files as part of the application, pre-generated on deployment offers some great flexibility. \r\n\r\nThis could be taken a step further with the functionality I describe in [this comment](http://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5379#issuecomment-4440921). Which would make `rake assets:precompile:all` and the new config I proposed unnecessary and `rake assets:precompile` would simply run either digest or nondigest only, depending on the setting of `config.assets.digest`. This would in turn simplify the `assets:precompile` task itself and not require shenanigans with `Kernal.exec` and would speed up execution.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5238191abd3543c15100e13d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5379#issuecomment-4478304"}
