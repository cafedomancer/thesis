{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5379", "repo": "rails", "body": "@josh I know, the flag initially introduced at the start of this pull request was only intended to be an unobtrusive addition so as not to affect any existing functionality.\r\n\r\nHowever after discussing with @josevalim the direction I am now heading towards is moving all the default rails static assets in **public** to within the asset pipeline so they may be precompiled. Being able to have these files as part of the application, pre-generated on deployment offers some great flexibility. \r\n\r\nThis could be taken a step further with the functionality I describe in [this comment](http://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5379#issuecomment-4440921). Which would make `rake assets:precompile:all` and the new config I proposed unnecessary and `rake assets:precompile` would simply run either digest or nondigest only, depending on the setting of `config.assets.digest`. This would in turn simplify the `assets:precompile` task itself and not require shenanigans with `Kernal.exec` and would speed up execution.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5238191abd3543c15100e13d"}, "issue_id": 5379, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4478304", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5379#issuecomment-4478304", "updated_at": "2012-03-13T17:21:26Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice", "login": "davidjrice", "gravatar_id": "71f4402df3b4cdc8230e9922d3c5af32", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidjrice", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/71f4402df3b4cdc8230e9922d3c5af32?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fde73998802680548b916f1947ffbad76.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1971, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-13T17:17:34Z", "id": 4478304, "owner": "rails"}
