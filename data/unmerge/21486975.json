Thank you! :sunflower: \r\n\r\nHowever, the problem with your implementation is that we have twice the same code, in `destroy` and `destroy!`.\r\nAvoiding code duplication would make this PR awesome.\r\nWhat you could do is using `destroy!` in the `destroy` method, but rescuing the exception, so true or false is returned.\r\nAlso, don't forget the transaction, as mentioned in the inline comments.\r\n\r\nAlso, you added some documentation.\r\nBut in the examples, you kept the usage of `destroy` even though it should be `destroy!`.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237dc7dbd3543c1510089e2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10682#issuecomment-21486975"}
