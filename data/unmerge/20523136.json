My proposal is only when using `delegate` to a Hash treat keys/values as attribute accessors.\r\n\r\n@pftg `serialize` was just an example, the focus is on the `delegate`.  \r\n\r\nBTW, it is only a proposal. Even being nice in my example, it may not be interesting to add it into `delegate`.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d6ebbd3543c151008326"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11262#issuecomment-20523136"}
