My proposal is only when using `delegate` to a Hash treat keys/values as attribute accessors.\r\n\r\n@pftg `serialize` was just an example, the focus is on the `delegate`.  \r\n\r\nBTW, it is only a proposal. Even being nice in my example, it may not be interesting to add it into `delegate`.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d6ebbd3543c151008326"}, "issue_id": 11262, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20523136", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11262#issuecomment-20523136", "updated_at": "2013-07-08T02:27:07Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phstc/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phstc/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phstc/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phstc/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/phstc", "login": "phstc", "gravatar_id": "1e9ce2c15d24684d45ae475c5d9fc4d4", "html_url": "https://github.com/phstc", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phstc/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phstc/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phstc/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/1e9ce2c15d24684d45ae475c5d9fc4d4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff2edaa0602de5995ee08d2e9124b1e9d.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phstc/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 105652, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/phstc/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-05T14:59:17Z", "id": 20523136, "owner": "rails"}
