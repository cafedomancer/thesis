I listed several reasons why you would want to use threads in tandem with multiple processes in this post: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6348775\n\nSince MRI/YARV has a GIL, if you are using it on a multiprocessor box, even with threads, you are going to want to run several processes to utilize all available CPU cores, as the GIL precludes multicore operation.\n\nMultiprocess is orthogonal to multithreaded.
