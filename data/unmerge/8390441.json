Do people not understand Ruby, OO, good design? What is the benefit of divorcing Rails from Ruby? Do people find Ruby a difficult programming language? Is the goal here to get more non-programmers writing Rails?\n\n(I'm genuinely curious, because I feel that I have to understand the cause problem before I can help stop it.)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fac1bd3543c15100b6b4"}, "issue_id": 7520, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8390441", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7520#issuecomment-8390441", "updated_at": "2012-09-08T16:26:49Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/srbaker/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/srbaker/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/srbaker/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/srbaker/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/srbaker", "login": "srbaker", "gravatar_id": "3c8c4b69930a102c3ca698cc4cbcbf0b", "html_url": "https://github.com/srbaker", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/srbaker/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/srbaker/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/srbaker/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3c8c4b69930a102c3ca698cc4cbcbf0b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F79fde5402cbc75ae0615c9ae4c335b46.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/srbaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4538, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/srbaker/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-08T16:26:49Z", "id": 8390441, "owner": "rails"}
