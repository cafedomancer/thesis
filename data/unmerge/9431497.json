{"body": "@Antiarchitect well, a good place for you to start asking for feedback whether this feature (or others) is useful or not, is always the Rails Core mailing list.\r\n\r\nNow about the feature itself, besides @rafaelfranca comments - which I agree, my other argument is that Active Record has been moving to a \"less hash arguments\" approach lately, which I think would go against this. \r\n\r\nMoreover, you can probably build the same thing with associations in case you really want that:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Author < AR::Base\r\n  has_many :books\r\n  has_many :special_books, conditions: \"price < 5\", order: \"price ASC\", limit: 5\r\nend\r\n\r\n@authors.to_xml include: :special_books\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I don't see a real need to change Rails since you can achieve the same right now.
