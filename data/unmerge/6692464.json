{"body": "**Important**: added an updated explanation to the pull request's main text further up.\n\n----\n\n@josevalim:\n\n> 1) Do we really need to make the LookupContext change? The lookup context exists just in the request life-cycle, it is not shared in between requests.\n\nDo you mean the `formats=` change? If you do, there is more info in the 6a1f50b127cfe commit message.\n\nIf you mean the global `@details_keys` cache, then it is necessary because this is lazy initialisation and mine [ThreadSafetyTester](https://github.com/thedarkone/rack-contrib/blob/thread-safety-tester/lib/rack/contrib/thread_safety_tester.rb) was picking it up.\n\n> 2) I don't like the Resolver change. Instead of having 4 nested hashes each with its lock, maybe we should simply have one hash/cache and use an array with 4 elements as key. Can we have some benchmarks in that code to show which one is faster?\n\nNo locking is done by `Cache#[]`. Don't know about the array key, will bench that later.\n\n> 3) Many of the changes done here are simply a cache. Using a structure with a mutex for such cases in MRI is an unnecessary overhead, since a simple Hash would be fine because we don't care if two different threads eventually execute the same piece of code. What do you think? Can we have a structure that complies with this?\n\n`ThreadSafe::Cache` is just a wrapper for a `Hash` instance on MRI, it fully relies on GIL for protection, no mutexes are involved.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6692464", "created_at": "2012-07-01T10:22:37Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6917#issuecomment-6692464", "updated_at": "2012-07-01T10:22:37Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6917, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/thedarkone", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/c203190318ed9534390c93d1744a6cf1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F68e4593563e1b425a7717504bca103d6.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/received_events", "gravatar_id": "c203190318ed9534390c93d1744a6cf1", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "thedarkone", "type": "User", "id": 15688, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thedarkone/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523801f5bd3543c15100c22b"}, "id": 6692464, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6917"}
