To make a class method really private, you have to call `private` in the context of the singleton class:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass PredicateBuilder\r\n  class << self\r\n    def public_class_method; end\r\n\r\n    private\r\n      def private_class_method; end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, that's not that much of a big deal, just an interesting fact to know. I don't know if you should bother with this class as it is internally marked as \"private\" because of the `:nodoc:`  comment.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d97bbd3543c1510085c5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11022#issuecomment-19749120"}
