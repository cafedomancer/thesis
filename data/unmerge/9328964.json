{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7901", "repo": "rails", "body": "Regardless of documentation, the intention is clearly for the form to have a closing tag.  When a block is given, or when the form_tag function is used in the context of an HTML::Document object (as was happening in all the unit tests prior to this fix), that closing tag shows up.  In the block_given case, see line 764 where this is explicitly the case.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this issue is to introduce consistency and avoid unusual behavior that can take some serious time to debug (how do you think I found this issue?).  If that requires updating the documentation--which is already inconsistent with the (more common) block_given use of form_tag--then the documentation should be updated.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7cfbd3543c15100b12b"}, "issue_id": 7901, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9328964", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7901#issuecomment-9328964", "updated_at": "2012-10-11T05:31:36Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/betesh/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/betesh/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/betesh/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/betesh/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/betesh", "login": "betesh", "gravatar_id": "b8dc4b76792ff3c8cd993aa4c9c467f6", "html_url": "https://github.com/betesh", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/betesh/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/betesh/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/betesh/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b8dc4b76792ff3c8cd993aa4c9c467f6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F1c950f82143f74f12fe74420234ea39c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/betesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2154282, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/betesh/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-11T05:24:05Z", "id": 9328964, "owner": "rails"}
