{"body": "This functionality *should* be supported now on master.  You can register OIDs with ActiveRecord:: ConnectionAdapters:: PostgreSQLAdapter::OID.  Take a look [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/oid.rb).  At the bottom we map [names to types](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql/oid.rb#L200-203).  The names come from the `pg_type` table.  Adding a custom domain will add a record to your `pg_type` table, so you should just register the type along with the object you want to use for typecasting.  If you just want the type to act like an existing type, use the `alias_type` method.\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense?  Does your patch accomplish things this does not?
