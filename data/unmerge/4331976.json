{"body": "@NZKoz I'm from the google security team. I'm one of the researchers that discovered possible crypto attacks in Ruby on Rails (and many other frameworks), so I guess I'm qualified to comment here.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant in the second issue is that we don't want somebody with a key recovery attack on HMAC to be able to decrypt our data as well.\r\n\r\nAnd for the padding oracle issue: we want to prevent the re-use of config.secret_token in unauthenticated encryptions elsewhere in plugins, applications or Rails itself from undermining the authenticated encryption that we use in CookieStore. If we use the same key everywhere, then developers might think it's okay to re-use the key for other purposes as well, and then all it takes to decrypt our cookies is only one mistake. This is exactly what happened in ASP.NET, and I strongly suggest we should not make the same mistake in Rails.\r\n\r\nYou might think that all of the issues I raised are too conservative, but this is crypto and experience tells us that we should be conservative as much as possible when it comes to this area.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4331976", "created_at": "2012-03-05T21:15:40Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5034#issuecomment-4331976", "updated_at": "2012-03-05T21:15:40Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5034, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thaidn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thaidn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thaidn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thaidn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thaidn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/thaidn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thaidn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b514ef10e0279a1e3a73e99633555163?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Faeecc5a9c646444f00978ed43e747a96.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thaidn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thaidn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "b514ef10e0279a1e3a73e99633555163", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thaidn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "thaidn", "type": "User", "id": 7532, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thaidn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52381d9dbd3543c15100e5e1"}, "id": 4331976, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5034"}
