{"body": "as for reflection: it's really not the same.\r\n\r\nthe patch is using that technique, for simple cases.\r\n\r\nbut with hints, you can add messages that are hints and not errors.\r\n\r\nI hope I can explain this.\r\n\r\nAdding to hints, would give you a big area to talk to users, and those would be different things then reporting the error.\r\n\r\nalso, there is things like (in en.yml)\r\n    inclusion:\r\n        in: \"must be one of %{count}\"\r\n     associated: \"is invalid\"\r\n      uniqueness: \"must be unique\"\r\n      confirmation: \"doesn't match confirmation\"\r\n      acceptance: \"must be accepted\"\r\n\r\ncompared with\r\n\r\n      inclusion: \"is not included in the list\"\r\n      exclusion: \"is reserved\"\r\n      invalid: \"is invalid\"\r\n      confirmation: \"doesn't match %{attribute}\"\r\n      accepted: \"must be accepted\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example 'inclusion'.\r\nFor an error, you want 'Name is not included in the list'\r\nbut for a hint you want ' Select a Name from the list'\r\n\r\nI hope that is clear enough, it is the same for many other Validators.\r\n\r\nYou would need separate messages for hints and errors in many occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI agree, by far not all apps would benefit. But it wouldn't hurt either.\r\n\r\nI really don't care if you dont' want this in rails. I can live without it, and use the gem validation_hints. (but the other named gems could benefit from that directly!)\r\n\r\nI understand that there are much more pressing issues.\r\n\r\nBut I want to contribute to rails. Please do give me the benefit of the doubt, and needless to say I am very happy with Rafael's reactions after the close.\r\n\r\nI just want to be part of this. It took me 5 years to learn RoR and maybe I can do only one pull request per year. Dont dismiss it so easily ( but dismiss it by all means if it is not suitable).\r\n\r\nThx guys (and girls).\r\n\r\nOh and the not so DRY repeating of errors.rb. If I knew how to do that better, I'd do it; I think 80% of that file (errors.rb) could be factored out and just include it in errors.rb and hints.rb (add, delete, all that stuff).\r\n\r\n'night.\r\n\r\nAce\r\n\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11667681", "created_at": "2012-12-25T01:11:16Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8602#issuecomment-11667681", "updated_at": "2012-12-25T01:11:16Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8602, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/acesuares", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dfc4136712f120023f092004f062cc4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Faeefb050911334869a7a5d9e4d0e1689.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/received_events", "gravatar_id": "3dfc4136712f120023f092004f062cc4", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "acesuares", "type": "User", "id": 2784, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/acesuares/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f1babd3543c15100a4b2"}, "id": 11667681, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8602"}
