{"body": "I respectfully disagree.\r\n\r\nThe choice to include Sprockets should be left up to the developer, as there is an alternative in Jammit and potentially something else I do not know about. If somebody wishes to turn off the Sprockets part of Rails, that should still be a configurable option.\r\n\r\nThe best way to have this happen is to have the `sprockets-rails` gem act as a bridge between Sprockets and Rails. It is my belief that this is entirely possible. The configuration settings that are currently in `railties/lib/rails/application/configuration.rb` need to be moved out and into the gem. Functionally, it will be identical to what we have now, but people can opt-out of all the \"crap\" if they choose.\r\n\r\nI am not saying that Sprockets is inferior in any way. I have \"argued\" with people that Sprockets is a better alternative to Jammit as it allows for pre-compilation of assets and is the \"standard\" in future versions of Rails. Still, the people will revolt and continue to use what they have been using up until now, which is Jammit. Allowing people to turn it off is a *good thing*.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1446504", "created_at": "2011-06-27T10:53:57Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1855#issuecomment-1446504", "updated_at": "2011-06-27T11:46:07Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 1855, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/radar", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9a2a53db8e9b4476038c94a64b32833f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F573eec40e4ef4f2089531dd5cbf629f8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9a2a53db8e9b4476038c94a64b32833f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "radar", "type": "User", "id": 2687, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/radar/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52384d2bbd3543c151011492"}, "id": 1446504, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1855"}
