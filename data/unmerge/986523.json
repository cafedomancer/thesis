On that front, one of the things that bugs me about the rspec way is the overloading of ==. I think something.should_equal(something_else) would offend my sense of aesthetics much less (there are other problems still, like how you can't just stick with a tiny set of asserts because you have to map out all possibilities when assert <SOMETHING> is such a powerful way to avoid test method proliferation). Anyway, back on topic :)\r\n\r\nI don't like any of the words that could work for either. I love #in? when it's applied to an explicit array \"object in? array\", but I don't like it at all for when it's varargs \"object in? option, option\". That's the reason Object#in? never went anywhere a couple of years ago when we last considered it, because I just didn't like it applied to the varags. I think the in?/among? combo is the best deal for the positive case. I'm also very sold on ex? for the negative in? case but would like to have a great negative among? case too.", "_id": {"$oid": "52386422bd3543c1510125be"}, "issue_id": 258, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/986523", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/258#issuecomment-986523", "updated_at": "2011-04-11T22:33:30Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh", "login": "dhh", "gravatar_id": "ed9635566b34ade32274f510f0f9a6d2", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhh", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ed9635566b34ade32274f510f0f9a6d2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fcdcb2f5c7b071143529ef7f2705dfbc4.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2741, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-11T22:33:30Z", "id": 986523, "owner": "rails"}
