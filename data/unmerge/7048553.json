{"body": "I understand that the generation of a large initializer is unappealing. Maybe it would make sense to move the inflections (possibly the entire inflector) to a gem? This would provide an easy way to version it, and it could be an optional (for Rails apps) or required dependency (for Rails) depending on how you guys want to handle that. Obviously, parts of Rails seem to depend on the Inflector (but not necessarily the inflections themselves), but it's arguably a nifty piece of software that could benefit non-Rails Ruby apps.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7048553", "created_at": "2012-07-17T20:33:25Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7071#issuecomment-7048553", "updated_at": "2012-07-17T20:33:25Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7071, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidcelis", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3e1a626a9e0c39eb548886c253bf9644.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "davidcelis", "type": "User", "id": 36873, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380016bd3543c15100bf31"}, "id": 7048553, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7071"}
