Debating semantics is utterly pointless, but it is worth acknowledging that this particular discussion about PUT has been around for lot longer than this PR - which suggests that there is, in fact, more than one valid interpretation.\r\n\r\nSo even if \"we must follow the spec at all costs\" was a valid logical argument - in this instance it doesn't really move us forward due to the unavoidable reality that part of the spec in question is up to interpretation.\r\n\r\nSo, as I've said previously in this thread, I think we're far better off focusing on the **actual benefits and problems** of moving away from or staying with partial idempotent updates. I've already made a case for sticking with what we have:\r\n\r\nPIUs are important, particularly for mobile devices that operate on crappy networks and need to be able to make extremely granular requests (i.e. partials) that can be retried easily on failure (i.e. idempotently).\r\n\r\nThe fact is, rails behaves this way - it's demonstrably useful, and non-demonstrably detrimental to either rails applications or the web as a whole.\r\n\r\nI think it's probably better to leave it as it is - given the contention over 2616 - and wait to see what happens with httpbis.\r\n\r\n*Aside from the concerns about following the spec,* why do you think partial updates via PUT are bad for either rails apps or the web?", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c15101214f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3194099"}
