I'm sorry I said it was \"silly\" just because it's different.\n\nOn-topic: Nuts. Here I will cry \"uncle\" and admit I was wrong. I use the hell out of Object#present? This is similar. When I'm in for a penny, I'm in for a pound. I withdraw my protest.\n\nEvan Light\nOn Sunday, April 10, 2011 at 2:18 PM, dhh wrote: \n> I offered you a clear explanation of why the semantic difference mattered and my personal appreciation for that difference. You choose to take to first belittle that argument with \"silly\" and then consider it a slight. Now you're crying uncle because I didn't pick up on your off-ticket request for forgiveness on silly?

(no, #out? doesn't fit, and #not_in? is ugly). Just like we have blank/present and include/exclude. I already have a good fit for #either? in #neither? but I'm hesitant to add it unless we can find a version for #in?.\n> \n> How's that for expressiveness.
