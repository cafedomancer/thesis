{"body": "@homakov Yes, there are cases when this check will not help. However changing Ruby would be hard and would take a long time, and the problem is that it's not \"wrong\" it's just \"different\" than some other languages. Changing Regexp would break a lot of things.\n\nI was thinking about cases like you mentioned but I don't think there is an easy, harmless solution for that.\nHowever if we change the validator we will bring awareness, and we will also help people fix a lot of bad Regexps, since many times the error will occur in validates_format_of. Without bringing incompatible changes. Even if you have custom code like that, if you have any validates_format_of, chances are you are doing the same thing wrong there, so at least you will become aware of the problem. So yes we will not fix all the problems. But we will fix a big portion without being annoying or breaking existing code, and with a very simple check that does not bloat the framework.\n\nIt is possible also to write validations like the one you gave as example using validates_format_of (just build a custom validator that uses that inside) - in that case the warning would still work. But in any case I think this kind of fix is good because it will not break any existing code, but it will still raise awareness + it is very simple. It would be very hard to get Regexp class changed.\n\nBackport would only give a warning and would not change any behavior so I don't think people will get mad.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6078769", "created_at": "2012-06-02T16:28:19Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6569#issuecomment-6078769", "updated_at": "2012-06-02T16:33:03Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6569, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/mrbrdo", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/eda6e2638857d20ae499d26432e1a221?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa767c168a69e9b80282f6d93b32fbb05.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/received_events", "gravatar_id": "eda6e2638857d20ae499d26432e1a221", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "mrbrdo", "type": "User", "id": 167990, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrbrdo/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238067dbd3543c15100c91e"}, "id": 6078769, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6569"}
