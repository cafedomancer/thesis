{"body": ":disappointed:\r\n\r\nI specifically split this pull request into six commits so it would be easier to resolve conflicts. I understand the desire not to apply widespread changes in a large project like Rails but isn't the whole point of using a distributed version control system like Git so that we can make such changes without major conflict? If there are any conflicts, resolving them should be straightforward.\r\n\r\nIf this is being updated step by step, it will take a very long time to convert the entire codebase. In the meantime, tests will be inconsistent and harder to read.
