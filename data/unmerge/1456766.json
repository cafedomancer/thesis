{"body": "@radar -- great, glad to hear it. And for the record, thank you *very much* for undertaking the work actually referred to by this pull request. And pardon me for so doggedly pursuing the issue, especially since I didn't understand the @josevalim's solution completely resolves my concerns.\r\n\r\n@josevalim -- thank you for the great solution, and for showing me that I had completely misunderstood it. I was stuck on the idea that customizers would still need to have `gem 'rails'` in their `Gemfile`s and then break down the dependencies by replacing `rails/all` in `application.rb` (with `require 'action_pack/railtie`, `require 'action_mailer/railtie`, etc). \r\n\r\nNow I get it.
