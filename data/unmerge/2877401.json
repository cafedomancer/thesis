See https://github.com/waseem/rails/commit/2a1a907e4ca940b50a421351c05929ce3e45df5a But am not submitting a pull request because I am unable to write tests cases for plugin installation.\r\n\r\nI have put a `railties/test/application/plugin_test.rb ` file that will hold tests for plugin installation/removal etcetera.\r\n\r\nI was not able to write tests because if you see line#15 of `plugin_test.rb`, when I try to do `bundle exec rails plugin install`, test tries to really install the plugin. Is there a way I could stub out `Plugin#install_using_#{method}` methods?\r\n\r\nI also posted a message on core mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-core/2dm6tb6OcHM but did not get any responses.", "_id": {"$oid": "523865b1bd3543c151012723"}, "issue_id": 208, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2877401", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/208#issuecomment-2877401", "updated_at": "2011-11-25T19:23:44Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem", "login": "waseem", "gravatar_id": "20b986aecf495c7a1d9b1910bd5f2cd2", "html_url": "https://github.com/waseem", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/20b986aecf495c7a1d9b1910bd5f2cd2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7a99ddd64872e5a6b4084867dd14ef4a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 42636, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/waseem/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-25T19:23:44Z", "id": 2877401, "owner": "rails"}
