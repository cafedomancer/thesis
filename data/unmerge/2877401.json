Is there a way I could stub out `Plugin#install_using_#{method}` methods?\r\n\r\nI also posted a message on core mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-core/2dm6tb6OcHM but did not get any responses.", "_id": {"$oid": "523865b1bd3543c151012723"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/208#issuecomment-2877401"}
