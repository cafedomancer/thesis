I think the main point of contention is whether or not we insert `Rack::Lock` in the middleware.\n\n> Let me add I don't understand why we insert Rack::Lock, are there use cases where people want to deploy a non-thread-safe app in a threaded server? Seems a weird combination to me (and those users could insert the middleware themselves in any case). \n\nI have exactly the same doubts.  I'll need to check out the webrick situation though! :-)", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c714"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6440350"}
