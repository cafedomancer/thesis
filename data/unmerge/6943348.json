I'm sure a better name exists, perhaps `deep_clean`?\n\nIt's really just a convenience method for tightening up collections when you expect there to be empty data. When working with ActiveRecord objects nils and empty strings can often mean the same thing. A user submits a form and removes a phone number. That value is now an empty string. It's perfectly fine for the value to be an empty string (or nil) but I don't need it to be in the collection I'm working with. `compact` is nice, but I have to do additional processing to remove the strings, which is annoying.\n\n```ruby\n@phone_numbers = Person.all.map(&:phone_numbers).clean\n# [\n#  {:home => \"1-123-456-7890\", :work => [\"1-098-765-4321\", \"1-222-333-4444\"], :cell => \"1-802-123-3211\"},\n#  {:home => \"1-123-456-7890\" }\n#  ...\n# ]\n```\n\nThis could be from an ActiveRecord model that uses `store` or a serialized hash.
