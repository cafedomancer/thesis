[edit: this doesn't make much sense - clarified in the last paragraph below]\n\nIt's not like developers call `bundle update` in production (right?) .. here's how I normally do it:\n\n* Specify `~> 3.2.5` in Gemfile\n* bundle update rails\n* run tests locally\n* commit Gemfile.lock change to a new branch and run against CI where possible\n* problems found -> fix problems\n* deploy to production\n\nIf you run a normal `bundle install` then the version won't upgrade.. which means when you do run bundle update you're in a state where you're fully prepared to mitigate any issues that arise.\n\nIf you're a gem author then this change is irrelevant to you as you'll be specifying a Rails version dependency in your .gemspec file.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380636bd3543c15100c89d"}, "issue_id": 6610, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6090545", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6610#issuecomment-6090545", "updated_at": "2012-06-04T00:43:49Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/parndt/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/parndt/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/parndt/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/parndt/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/parndt", "login": "parndt", "gravatar_id": "fe9ccfa856aa05ff2d534fcf87cc74f5", "html_url": "https://github.com/parndt", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/parndt/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/parndt/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/parndt/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/fe9ccfa856aa05ff2d534fcf87cc74f5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85c9f9efab89cee90a95cb98f15feacd.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/parndt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 10128, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/parndt/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-04T00:41:16Z", "id": 6090545, "owner": "rails"}
