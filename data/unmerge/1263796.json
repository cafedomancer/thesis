That would clearly cause pain if someone was generating a mailbag against a set from the database (which can be one or more than one).\r\n\r\nThe whole problem is that Foo.bar is now returning a MailBag when it shouldn't. On the other hand, I don't see how we can keep backward compatibility without introducing an specific entry point for the mail bag, like: Notification.bag(:plan_expire).", "_id": {"$oid": "523857cfbd3543c151011bac"}, "issue_id": 1411, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1263796", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1411#issuecomment-1263796", "updated_at": "2011-05-30T21:48:21Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-30T21:48:21Z", "id": 1263796, "owner": "rails"}
