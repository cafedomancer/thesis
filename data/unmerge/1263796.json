That would clearly cause pain if someone was generating a mailbag against a set from the database (which can be one or more than one).\r\n\r\nThe whole problem is that Foo.bar is now returning a MailBag when it shouldn't. On the other hand, I don't see how we can keep backward compatibility without introducing an specific entry point for the mail bag, like: Notification.bag(:plan_expire).", "_id": {"$oid": "523857cfbd3543c151011bac"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1411#issuecomment-1263796"}
