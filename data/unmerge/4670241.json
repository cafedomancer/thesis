You can have an expectation that the behaviour of a public method shouldn't change without a good reason. I do not find removing a couple of `!` to be a good reason.\r\n\r\nI've learned something today, about my preconceived notion that methods with `?` will always be `true` or `false`. I'll digest that later.\r\n\r\nThe reality is in this case there is no harm in going by going back to the previous implementation, and a lot of potential harm and confusion by keeping it the way it is now.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e232"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4670241", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4670241", "updated_at": "2012-03-24T00:09:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis", "login": "vertis", "gravatar_id": "b2a9e57c2a8ed757833b4c787b6c51d5", "html_url": "https://github.com/vertis", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b2a9e57c2a8ed757833b4c787b6c51d5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84e17d99a1e885b374d0cb2e25d7aa4b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 19705, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-24T00:09:20Z", "id": 4670241, "owner": "rails"}
