I didn't think about it.\r\n\r\n@josevalim, anonymous controllers are used anywhere, aren't they? I see code which supports them, but I can imagine only something like this:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nSimpleRailsApp::Application.routes.draw do\r\n  klass = Class.new(ApplicationController){\r\n    def text\r\n      render text: 'demo'\r\n    end\r\n  }\r\n  get 'url', to: klass.action(:text)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nHm. It's not very nice.\r\n\r\nI found and patched a defect in anonymous controllers layout lookup and doubt should I pull it or not.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381b66bd3543c15100e3f1"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5201#issuecomment-4210746"}
