The Rails core team work amazingly hard, for free, to keep Rails current and keep reviewing contributions while still driving forward to Rails 4.0 _and beyond_. \r\n\r\nThank you! I, for one, *really* appreciate it. Even when I do disagree it's _usually_ over something quite trivial like code formatting :)\r\n\r\n@josevalim for what it's worth, you're one of the best & nicest maintainers of OSS I've seen so far.. it sucks that it takes its toll on you.", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd59"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4749471"}
