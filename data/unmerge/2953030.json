{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3802", "repo": "rails", "body": "Sure et I hear ya and at first glance it doesn't seem to be doing a lot, but how would you do this with an alias in all rails envs? \r\n\r\nrake tail is always going to pick the correct environment log file dynamically \r\n\r\nSay you came up with a nifty bash alias or function that you could pass the current Rails.env such as development, production, staging, training, etc... you'd have to deploy/maintain that alias/function on every server/desktop.  \r\n\r\nWorking with rails I've found myself doing tail -f log/guessenv [tab] over and over again on multiple servers and development environments.\r\n\r\nDon't know about you but I'm tired of typing tail -f -n100 log/whateva [tab] when I could just do a rake tail instead.\r\n\r\nWhich looks easier on the fingers when done repetitively on different servers and environments day after day?\r\n\r\nrake tail\r\n\r\nor having to constantly to do this?\r\n\r\ntail -f -n100 log/dev  [tab]\r\ntail -f -n100 log/prod  [tab]\r\ntail -f -n100 log/train  [tab]\r\ntail -f -n100 log/stag  [tab]\r\n\r\nI mean the same argument could be made about rake log:clear as this could easily be setup as an alias/function too. I'm glad someone didn't think this should be an alias.\r\n\r\nIt would be really handy to type rake tail in every environment to quickly view the current rails env log.\r\n\r\nNow the windows os check was recommended in the old pull request and sounded like a good idea so I added it:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3801\r\n\r\nSo that's where the windows os recommendation came from.  I'd be willing to bet there's not many brave enough to be running rails on a non nix prod environment so those lines of code will only execute rarely.\r\n\r\nI guesstimate 99% of devs working in a rails env will be using a nix os with tail, so that leaves about 1% that could load the os specific code which prints a friendly message that their os doesn't support tail. So they just end up doing what they've been doing to view the log files :)\r\n\r\nIf you have a better/different approach that's easier to maintain please share!\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52383163bd3543c15100f748"}, "issue_id": 3802, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2953030", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3802#issuecomment-2953030", "updated_at": "2011-11-30T16:47:13Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal", "login": "scottvrosenthal", "gravatar_id": "6a54102d3af783bab96b14b59f25f8b0", "html_url": "https://github.com/scottvrosenthal", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/6a54102d3af783bab96b14b59f25f8b0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc02a484869d06f0d258fa58ce110ac8a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 507446, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-30T00:25:56Z", "id": 2953030, "owner": "rails"}
