{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7457", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks for reviewing this pull request so quickly.\n\n@tenderlove is correct, if this feature is proven valuable, it will be resubmitted against master, with proper changelogs and such.\n\n@josevalim Yes, the debug logging for instantiation would be done for each sql query we currently do as a way to bookend the full request/response time.  We have not felt this debug logging was cumbersome in our extensive use of it in normal logging and in console.\n\nRE: slowness, in my testing on 3-2-stable the slowdown is barely visible. rake test_postgresql took roughly 1 second longer on my machine with this feature although I did add one test for the instantiations for joins.  We are open to the improvement of the feature since we believe it could be very useful to others as well.\n\nWe have had this feature in our code base for a while and very recently it became invaluable.\n\nI was migrating our app to ruby 1.9.3.  I installed 1.9.3-p125 and everything was fine.  I then installed 1.9.3-p194 and some of my pages were very slow to load and would sometimes timeout.  I turned on rails debug logging and I could see that one particular model was taking several seconds to instantiate ~150 rows.  Quickly I was able to isolate which model was slow, and that it had more serialized columns that it probably should.  \n\nThat led me to ask @tenderlove about it, and thankfully he pointed me at the commit (https://github.com/tenderlove/psych/commit/0845b0781abeac81132594c5cebf2630cb18933d) that fixed the Psych slowness in 1.9.3-p194.\n\nWithout this logging of instantiation times, we would have wasted many more hours trying to isolate the change in behavior.  \n\nWith this as context, @fryguy and I thought it would be useful if Rails included this information to complement the already useful logging of sql queries.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fb75bd3543c15100b7ec"}, "issue_id": 7457, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8093371", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7457#issuecomment-8093371", "updated_at": "2012-08-28T14:30:43Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrafanie/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrafanie/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrafanie/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrafanie/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrafanie", "login": "jrafanie", "gravatar_id": "9968b786345739e77c49dc09c4f6514c", "html_url": "https://github.com/jrafanie", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrafanie/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrafanie/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrafanie/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/9968b786345739e77c49dc09c4f6514c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4c72c61607ee5069a12fc62b912c3bdc.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrafanie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 19339, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jrafanie/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-28T14:27:47Z", "id": 8093371, "owner": "rails"}
