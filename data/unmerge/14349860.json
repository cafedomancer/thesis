The problem described in #9470 is all about setting `inverse_of` when using `find` in an association, to work the same way as `first` / `last`.\r\n\r\nThat seems fair, I don't see any problem in doing that. But I don't think Rails should try to find any record in the collection just by doing a `find` on it, moreover the user may want a fresh record and would now need to `reload` it. If you want to find a record in the association collection, you can use `find/detect/select/find_all` with a block. Also, at a glance it seems the code is calling `load_target` every time, which might load the full association for a simple `find` call, when no associated records are necessary.\r\n\r\nSo I think we'd be good if only setting the inverse association on `find` was improved, but I would rather not change `find` in Rails with this logic.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contribution :)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e8bfbd3543c151009760"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9503#issuecomment-14349860"}
