{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9503", "repo": "rails", "body": ":-1: on this. The problem described in #9470 is all about setting `inverse_of` when using `find` in an association, to work the same way as `first` / `last`.\r\n\r\nThat seems fair, I don't see any problem in doing that. But I don't think Rails should try to find any record in the collection just by doing a `find` on it, moreover the user may want a fresh record and would now need to `reload` it. If you want to find a record in the association collection, you can use `find/detect/select/find_all` with a block. Also, at a glance it seems the code is calling `load_target` every time, which might load the full association for a simple `find` call, when no associated records are necessary.\r\n\r\nSo I think we'd be good if only setting the inverse association on `find` was improved, but I would rather not change `find` in Rails with this logic.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contribution :)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e8bfbd3543c151009760"}, "issue_id": 9503, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14349860", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9503#issuecomment-14349860", "updated_at": "2013-03-03T16:43:31Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-03T16:43:31Z", "id": 14349860, "owner": "rails"}
