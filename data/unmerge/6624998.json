{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6826", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks for that discussion!!! I appreciate that. This might look like a ridiculous problem but actually it reflects a code design style issue in Rails.\n\nThe `#prepare` is absolutely not useless but guides people towards interfaces.\n\nWhat you do now is improving AV (since it doesn't know about `routes` internals anymore) but moving internal knowledge about AV into the controller (since it actively includes modules into AV). If we were using a \"useless\" #prepare method all the controller knows is \"AV wants me to pass modules needed in the view\" and AV knows \"I get modules in #prepare and I do whatever I want with it\".\n\nWhich brings us to the second point. If we want to add stuff to the preparation process now people will simply chug that into the #view_context_class breaking encapsulation again. Instead, we should think about an interface between AV and AC. E.g. #prepare accepting a block or whatever.\n\nThe point is we are working towards making AV replaceable. Now if the controller keeps monkey-patching the view class this makes our efforts useless.
