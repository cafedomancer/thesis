{"body": "@tenderlove I don't have any issue in mind off the top of my head, though I wonder about edge cases I don't foresee. I don't have certainty either though and I'll think about it.\n\nBut this is something akin to the connection pool for me: Why the heck is Rails generating a connection pool of size 5 **as a default** when the vast majority of applications do not even need a connection pool? Why not a connection of pool of size 1? Why not have the connection pool as an opt-in?\n\nI don't care it is ultra-cheap, only one connection is used in multi-process anyway, and all those arguments. It is conceptual, a user with a multi-process deployment in my view should not have thread-related configuration options to deal with. That's my conceptual mismatch with all this. And that is why I prefer off as a default that matches the majority of apps out there.\n\nThat being said, I don't feel strong about this. I have expressed my point of view to contribute to the discussion. If there was consensus in core that on is better that'd be OK for me.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6270638", "created_at": "2012-06-12T13:44:12Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6270638", "updated_at": "2012-06-12T13:44:12Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6685, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "fxn", "type": "User", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c70a"}, "id": 6270638, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6685"}
