I don't have certainty either though and I'll think about it.\n\nBut this is something akin to the connection pool for me: Why the heck is Rails generating a connection pool of size 5 **as a default** when the vast majority of applications do not even need a connection pool? Why not a connection of pool of size 1? Why not have the connection pool as an opt-in?\n\nI don't care it is ultra-cheap, only one connection is used in multi-process anyway, and all those arguments. It is conceptual, a user with a multi-process deployment in my view should not have thread-related configuration options to deal with. That's my conceptual mismatch with all this. And that is why I prefer off as a default that matches the majority of apps out there.\n\nThat being said, I don't feel strong about this. I have expressed my point of view to contribute to the discussion. If there was consensus in core that on is better that'd be OK for me.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c70a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6270638"}
