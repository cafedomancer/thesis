{"body": "In 3.2.x I've experienced that this can bite you due to differences in the way autoload works in development/production.\n\nWhen I switched threadsafe! = true some files that looked like this:\n\n```ruby\nclass Whatever::Something\nend\n```\n\nWorked in development, but the app bit the dust in production because of the implicit Whatever module. If I understand correctly, autoload is not threadsafe. Is autoload going to be around in Rails 4 development mode?\n\nIf so, can anything be done about identifying this kind of error short of running the app in production mode before deploying? Or perhaps get the implicit module behavior working when autoloading is disabled?\n\nedit: still :thumbsup:", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6215163", "created_at": "2012-06-08T23:25:19Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6215163", "updated_at": "2012-06-08T23:29:28Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6685, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/collin/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/collin/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/collin/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/collin", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/collin/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/collin", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/collin/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ed64926147995b3fce2ed2bc04f94537?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F574cdbbbe4c0155fb026c1b2cb5aafa6.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/collin/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/collin/received_events", "gravatar_id": "ed64926147995b3fce2ed2bc04f94537", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/collin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "collin", "type": "User", "id": 7783, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/collin/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c6dd"}, "id": 6215163, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6685"}
