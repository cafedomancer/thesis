There's a tradeoff between automatic security everywhere and leaving some power in the hands of the developer. When she creates a template called confirmation.text.erb we should acknowledge her decision and stop escaping HTML, since it quite obviously means the contents should be rendered as plain text.\n\nThis regression in Rails makes for some pretty stealthy problems where e.g. an ampersand in a person's name is suddenly escaped in emails. It looks horrible and unprofessional for the recipient of the email. So I would rather the pull request merged sooner than later.
