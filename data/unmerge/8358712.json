When she creates a template called confirmation.text.erb we should acknowledge her decision and stop escaping HTML, since it quite obviously means the contents should be rendered as plain text.\n\nThis regression in Rails makes for some pretty stealthy problems where e.g. an ampersand in a person's name is suddenly escaped in emails.
