In fact I'm beginning to believe that he shouldn't do anything.\r\n\r\n@fxn is (and has been) keeping sight of the bigger picture -- if you start making tiny changes based on the loud voices of a minority, then the code base will flip flop backwards and forwards any time someone has an issue (and sends it out to twitter). That's not a state we want rails to be in.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying I agree with the project policy regarding predicates, because I don't. But you have to respect that there *is* one, and that this isn't the place to change that. If the change is impossible for @clifton to live without in his app, then he can create a monkey patch.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e24e"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4723665", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4723665", "updated_at": "2012-03-27T18:53:58Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis", "login": "vertis", "gravatar_id": "b2a9e57c2a8ed757833b4c787b6c51d5", "html_url": "https://github.com/vertis", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b2a9e57c2a8ed757833b4c787b6c51d5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84e17d99a1e885b374d0cb2e25d7aa4b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 19705, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-27T18:53:58Z", "id": 4723665, "owner": "rails"}
