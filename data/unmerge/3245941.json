{"body": "If there would be a method, I would simply call it `replace_attributes`. BUT in my opinion and experience it doesn't make sense at all to have a method like this in Rails because `replace_attributes` would be tied to the model while its behavior should actually be given by the resource (which is then defined by the application). Remember that different actors in the system (for example user and admin) may see the same model as two different resources where PUT would behave differently for each. Even without those actors, a single model may be exposed as two different resources or vice-versa.\r\n\r\nIn other words, `replace_attributes` (or anything like that) would be a poor fit and ultimately lead to poorly designed APIs as people would believe that a call to `replace_attributes` would be everything you would need to have proper PUT semantics.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3245941", "created_at": "2011-12-22T06:21:37Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3245941", "updated_at": "2011-12-22T06:21:37Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 505, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012172"}, "id": 3245941, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/505"}
