I didn't realize that this was available, but I'll go ahead and extend that. The reason why I'm creating this is because I'm working on a message bus system: https://gist.github.com/tenderlove/ee2ceedeaac138d1d9ca.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that in development mode, a server could push filesystem changes to the browser using SSE's without the developer having to push refresh on the browser. The plan was to extend Notifications so that there would be a way to send notifications about the file system. \r\n\r\nSince it seems there's already an infrastructure in place for checking for file updates, I'm going to close this PR and work on extending FileUpdateChecker.
