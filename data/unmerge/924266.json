Tests definitely do not pass. However, it would be nice if delegate handled this automatically. It was thinking about something along these lines:\r\n\r\n    to = \"self.#{to}\" unless to.to_s.start_with? '@', 'self.'\r\n\r\nNot particularly elegant (and this example won't actually pass tests either), but I'll keep working on it. Hopefully I can come up with something that's nicer than `delegate :whatever, :to => \"self.module\"`.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nHaydn", "_id": {"$oid": "52386513bd3543c1510126a2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/234#issuecomment-924266"}
