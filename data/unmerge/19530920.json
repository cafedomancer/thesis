The fact that eager loading raises or not is greatly dependent on the result of the first query. In one case the query can select for records that meet the requested eager loaded associations and all will be fine. While in a different situation the same query raise an error. This to me is a more confusing (or surprising) behavior. By not raising the code keeps behaving the same.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237daa9bd3543c15100872b"}, "issue_id": 10912, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/19530920", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10912#issuecomment-19530920", "updated_at": "2013-06-17T08:00:14Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bertg/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bertg/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bertg/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bertg/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bertg", "login": "Bertg", "gravatar_id": "f80b5bd87ed2e62e1c3fd52e90ee7563", "html_url": "https://github.com/Bertg", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bertg/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bertg/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bertg/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f80b5bd87ed2e62e1c3fd52e90ee7563?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7895fc13088ee37f511913bac71fa66f.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bertg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1434, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bertg/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-06-17T08:00:14Z", "id": 19530920, "owner": "rails"}
