If model A references model B and both are autoloaded, both will be also wiped and there are not going to be any dangling references. When model A is loaded again, its relations are going to be also new objects, so the reference to the old B in previous relations is also gone (unless I am missing something).\r\n\r\nFWIW I believe I prefer to pass the class object as well, it is a more natural interface to me than the class name.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f3e9bd3543c15100a92c"}, "issue_id": 8357, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10844637", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8357#issuecomment-10844637", "updated_at": "2012-11-29T12:03:07Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-29T12:02:31Z", "id": 10844637, "owner": "rails"}
