{"body": "I like Jos\u00e9's idea. In Spanish and other languages you are still able to generate ASCII, though, because accents can be removed giving meaningful identifiers. For example, \"Francesc Maci\u00e0\" (a Catalan name) becomes \"francesc-macia\". So automating this may be tricky.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can also make it a function of the language, eg a hash table in the guides generator that says that if the locale is traditional chinese then you use MD5. Guides have few translations (if any), so a simple solution like that may suffice.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5404020", "created_at": "2012-04-29T10:25:08Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6043#issuecomment-5404020", "updated_at": "2012-04-29T10:25:08Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6043, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "fxn", "type": "User", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380fbfbd3543c15100d582"}, "id": 5404020, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6043"}
