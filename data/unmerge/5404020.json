In Spanish and other languages you are still able to generate ASCII, though, because accents can be removed giving meaningful identifiers. For example, \"Francesc Maci\u00e0\" (a Catalan name) becomes \"francesc-macia\". So automating this may be tricky.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can also make it a function of the language, eg a hash table in the guides generator that says that if the locale is traditional chinese then you use MD5. Guides have few translations (if any), so a simple solution like that may suffice.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380fbfbd3543c15100d582"}, "issue_id": 6043, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5404020", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6043#issuecomment-5404020", "updated_at": "2012-04-29T10:25:08Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-29T10:25:08Z", "id": 5404020, "owner": "rails"}
