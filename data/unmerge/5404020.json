In Spanish and other languages you are still able to generate ASCII, though, because accents can be removed giving meaningful identifiers. For example, \"Francesc Maci\u00e0\" (a Catalan name) becomes \"francesc-macia\". So automating this may be tricky.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can also make it a function of the language, eg a hash table in the guides generator that says that if the locale is traditional chinese then you use MD5. Guides have few translations (if any), so a simple solution like that may suffice.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380fbfbd3543c15100d582"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6043#issuecomment-5404020"}
