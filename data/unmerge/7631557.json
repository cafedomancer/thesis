This would be common in e-mails, but it assumes the e-mail is being processed during the same time as the request. As soon as you move the e-mail to the background, which will be easier than ever with Rails 4 Queue API, all bets are off. This is an issue that already happens with I18n.locale. I think URLs should be set explicitly and in general we should depend less on `Thread.current`. This approach may be fine for a plugin, but I strongly disagree with it for Rails.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fd63bd3543c15100bb0e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7307#issuecomment-7631557"}
