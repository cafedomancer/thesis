{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7307", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks for the PR but I have a strong :-1: opinion about this feature. This would be common in e-mails, but it assumes the e-mail is being processed during the same time as the request. As soon as you move the e-mail to the background, which will be easier than ever with Rails 4 Queue API, all bets are off. This is an issue that already happens with I18n.locale. I think URLs should be set explicitly and in general we should depend less on `Thread.current`. This approach may be fine for a plugin, but I strongly disagree with it for Rails.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fd63bd3543c15100bb0e"}, "issue_id": 7307, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7631557", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7307#issuecomment-7631557", "updated_at": "2012-08-10T00:57:58Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-10T00:57:58Z", "id": 7631557, "owner": "rails"}
