{"body": "Okay that's good to hear. I didn't realize that was going on, so that's awesome. I'll sit back and see what happens with that, then -- no point in me fussing over the requireability of helpers right now if the code's going to get moved.\n\nIn the meantime, side note: one thing I'm noticing is that in the case of NumberHelper it's not simply enough to require the right files. Many helpers are also dependent on i18n. Loading i18n isn't as easy as requiring 'activesupport/i18n', because that doesn't seem to have an effect. You still need to initialize i18n in some way -- at least load the default locale file. And it's unclear on how to do this exactly. The i18n railtie that ActiveSupport provides probably does this, but I feel like there should be a simpler way to do it.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5813867", "created_at": "2012-05-21T00:46:57Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6414#issuecomment-5813867", "updated_at": "2012-05-21T00:47:21Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6414, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/mcmire", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e9e852b18079792bc5f4ec52b8e37c53?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0d46839f6371fb84f6b6c682f5fc2c77.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e9e852b18079792bc5f4ec52b8e37c53", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "mcmire", "type": "User", "id": 7371, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523808b5bd3543c15100cc5c"}, "id": 5813867, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6414"}
