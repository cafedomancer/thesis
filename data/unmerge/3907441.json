In several ocassions I needed to pluck many attributes, not just a single one. And seeing people using the valium gem, I don't understand why you conclude that \"plucking a single value is going to be 99% of the use case\". When I need more performance it hurts me to go to my Gemfile and add something more. Rails should give me that efficiency out of the box. And it didn't cost much to accept the pull request. :-(", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f658"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3907441"}
