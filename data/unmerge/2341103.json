I think there's a better refactoring available.\r\n\r\nThis extracts the shared code, but I don't think it captures the meaning well.\r\n\r\nThere are two things happening with these methods:\r\n1) Rails is providing `:src` to Sprockets using `*sources` and `options[:body]`, and\r\n2) Rails is giving the option to split a source up into its constituent assets.\r\n\r\nSo it would be clearer to divide these behaviors into two modules: one to translate `*sources` to `:src` for Sprockets; another to handle splitting a source into multiple assets for debugging. The debuggable-assets module could share a private method to handle the asset splitting.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384123bd3543c1510109a5"}, "issue_id": 2689, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2341103", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2689#issuecomment-2341103", "updated_at": "2011-10-09T20:58:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy", "login": "jeremy", "gravatar_id": "24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremy", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84d9ee44e457ddef7f2c4f25dc8fa865.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 199, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-10-09T20:58:42Z", "id": 2341103, "owner": "rails"}
