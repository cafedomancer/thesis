I think there's a better refactoring available.\r\n\r\nThis extracts the shared code, but I don't think it captures the meaning well.\r\n\r\nThere are two things happening with these methods:\r\n1) Rails is providing `:src` to Sprockets using `*sources` and `options[:body]`, and\r\n2) Rails is giving the option to split a source up into its constituent assets.\r\n\r\nSo it would be clearer to divide these behaviors into two modules: one to translate `*sources` to `:src` for Sprockets; another to handle splitting a source into multiple assets for debugging. The debuggable-assets module could share a private method to handle the asset splitting.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384123bd3543c1510109a5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2689#issuecomment-2341103"}
