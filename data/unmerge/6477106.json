{"body": "I looked at this I thought, \"Hey, I tried to do this before and I thought this is not supposed to work...\". In case someone else is wondering about the same thing, here's why:\n\nIn Rails <= 3.2:\n\n```ruby\n>> \"address\".singularize\n=> \"addres\"\n```\n\nFor the longest time, (given the \"frozen\" status of the inflector) I thought this is how it's supposed to be (i.e. singularize is not idempotent), hence what @butzopower proposed would not work.\n\nIt turns out this is actually a bug and it was fixed in master in #4719. Based on the test cases in activesupport/test/inflector_test.rb, it does appear the infectors are supposed to be idempotent - at least that's the intention.
