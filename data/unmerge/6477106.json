In case someone else is wondering about the same thing, here's why:\n\nIn Rails <= 3.2:\n\n```ruby\n>> \"address\".singularize\n=> \"addres\"\n```\n\nFor the longest time, (given the \"frozen\" status of the inflector) I thought this is how it's supposed to be (i.e. singularize is not idempotent), hence what @butzopower proposed would not work.\n\nIt turns out this is actually a bug and it was fixed in master in #4719. Based on the test cases in activesupport/test/inflector_test.rb, it does appear the infectors are supposed to be idempotent - at least that's the intention. Therefore what @butzopower proposed is supposed to work on master.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e2563bd354364b900ddcb"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6802#issuecomment-6477106"}
