In fact I've just altered my commit to leave @dylanahsmith's test alone so you can simply apply [his branch][dylans-branch] to master and [our branch][our-branch] to 3-2.\r\n\r\n[dylans-branch]: https://github.com/dylanahsmith/rails/tree/fix-join-alias-integer-comparison\r\n[our-branch]: https://github.com/howaboutwe/rails/tree/3.2.12-join-regression\r\n\r\nI won't dispute the jankiness. I don't have very intimate knowledge of arel, but it kinda begs for an attribute node that knows the name and type of the attribute. Seems like a lot of work, though, and likely a performance hit.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237eaf3bd3543c151009aa0"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9268#issuecomment-13475574"}
