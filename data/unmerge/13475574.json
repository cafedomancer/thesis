{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9268", "repo": "rails", "body": "@jeremy Thanks for checking this out.\r\n\r\nMy commit isn't needed for master as `TableAlias` has an `engine` method in arel master. In fact I've just altered my commit to leave @dylanahsmith's test alone so you can simply apply [his branch][dylans-branch] to master and [our branch][our-branch] to 3-2.\r\n\r\n[dylans-branch]: https://github.com/dylanahsmith/rails/tree/fix-join-alias-integer-comparison\r\n[our-branch]: https://github.com/howaboutwe/rails/tree/3.2.12-join-regression\r\n\r\nI won't dispute the jankiness. I don't have very intimate knowledge of arel, but it kinda begs for an attribute node that knows the name and type of the attribute. Seems like a lot of work, though, and likely a performance hit.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237eaf3bd3543c151009aa0"}, "issue_id": 9268, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13475574", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9268#issuecomment-13475574", "updated_at": "2013-02-13T05:50:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oggy/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oggy/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oggy/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oggy/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oggy", "login": "oggy", "gravatar_id": "c515daf003a781a638d8a01e41a935a0", "html_url": "https://github.com/oggy", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oggy/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oggy/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oggy/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c515daf003a781a638d8a01e41a935a0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fafcb7a2f1c158286b48062cd885a9866.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oggy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 11112, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oggy/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-13T05:50:28Z", "id": 13475574, "owner": "rails"}
