This is not only an unnecessary performance penalty, it can also lead to non-deterministic behavior.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you use `post.comments.find_by_foo` somewhere, it will run it twice. Same for `post.comments.find_or_create`. A `post.comments.find_or_initialize` will initialize a new object twice, returning the latest.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383454bd3543c15100fb3c"}, "issue_id": 3610, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2801103", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3610#issuecomment-2801103", "updated_at": "2011-11-19T21:49:19Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlangenberg/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlangenberg/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlangenberg/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlangenberg/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlangenberg", "login": "mlangenberg", "gravatar_id": "49e98c4a13a5203ecff5d2d0774f8991", "html_url": "https://github.com/mlangenberg", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlangenberg/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlangenberg/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlangenberg/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/49e98c4a13a5203ecff5d2d0774f8991?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F860320be12a1c050cd7731794e231bd3.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlangenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 992, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mlangenberg/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-19T21:49:19Z", "id": 2801103, "owner": "rails"}
