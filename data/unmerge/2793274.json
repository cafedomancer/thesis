{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3674", "repo": "rails", "body": "Labels and buttons do the lookup, but they are rather an exception. They always come with a text. It is also easy to avoid the lookup for both, just pass the value explicitly.\r\n\r\nPlaceholders are totally the opposite. They are an addition to inputs and they are not always present, which causes unecessary lookups.\r\n\r\nI am also -1 for adding more logic to form_for and the form builder, they are supposed to be more low level and need a huge refactoring before adding more HTML5 behavior. There are already a bunch of form builders out there that can do it for you.", "_id": {"$oid": "523833b7bd3543c15100fa63"}, "issue_id": 3674, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2793274", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3674#issuecomment-2793274", "updated_at": "2011-11-18T19:37:01Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-18T19:37:01Z", "id": 2793274, "owner": "rails"}
