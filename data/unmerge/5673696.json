That option was not working at all, so I don't think was used too often. \n\nYes, it's only for JSON parser goals - \n```\n<script> var x=\"</script>\" \n```\nfails, of course. And we need to escape it - Thus - current implementation of escaping really should be set to +true+ by default - just nothing stops us, obviously a good idea.\n\nThe subject is to make *real* HTML escaping - protect developers when their $('body').append(comment.body) w/o escaping. controversial issue. OK, We can leave it \"as is\" but maybe raise some attention to the problem at security page? \n\nhttps://gist.github.com/2655020\nhttps://gist.github.com/2665901\n\nAm I only guy who found kind of that moronic code in my repos? If yes - nothing should be added :) But both attitudes seem common to me.\n\nthanks.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380bbbbd3543c15100d059"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6288#issuecomment-5673696"}
