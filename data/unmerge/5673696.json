That option was not working at all, so I don't think was used too often. \n\nYes, it's only for JSON parser goals - \n```\n<script> var x=\"</script>\" \n```\nfails, of course. And we need to escape it - Thus - current implementation of escaping really should be set to +true+ by default - just nothing stops us, obviously a good idea.\n\nThe subject is to make *real* HTML escaping - protect developers when their $('body').append(comment.body) w/o escaping. controversial issue. OK, We can leave it \"as is\" but maybe raise some attention to the problem at security page? \n\nhttps://gist.github.com/2655020\nhttps://gist.github.com/2665901\n\nAm I only guy who found kind of that moronic code in my repos? If yes - nothing should be added :) But both attitudes seem common to me.\n\nthanks.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380bbbbd3543c15100d059"}, "issue_id": 6288, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5673696", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6288#issuecomment-5673696", "updated_at": "2012-05-13T03:41:07Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov", "login": "homakov", "gravatar_id": "d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d", "html_url": "https://github.com/homakov", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc1464ded796adc7ac65355e3cc0df165.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 174693, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-13T03:27:49Z", "id": 5673696, "owner": "rails"}
