{"body": "```\r\nWhat is funny this would mark whole CVE-2013-0155 as invalid \r\nbecause it's programmer bug and not framework bug.\r\n````\r\n\r\n@imanel exactly!  CVE-2013-0155 isn't a bug.  It's an example of a programmer writing bad code.  All programmers should know that ANY incoming parameters cannot be trusted and always need to be sanitised. No framework can do that for you.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12106167", "created_at": "2013-01-10T16:48:47Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8870#issuecomment-12106167", "updated_at": "2013-01-10T16:48:47Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8870, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrencepit/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrencepit/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrencepit/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrencepit", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrencepit/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/lawrencepit", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrencepit/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/a31c2c26350e9e2b07fbd99fbd5ff520?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2b44928ae11fb9384c4cf38708677c48.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrencepit/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrencepit/received_events", "gravatar_id": "a31c2c26350e9e2b07fbd99fbd5ff520", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrencepit/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "lawrencepit", "type": "User", "id": 115, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lawrencepit/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ef20bd3543c15100a0c6"}, "id": 12106167, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8870"}
