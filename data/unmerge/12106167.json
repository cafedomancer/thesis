CVE-2013-0155 isn't a bug.  It's an example of a programmer writing bad code.  All programmers should know that ANY incoming parameters cannot be trusted and always need to be sanitised. No framework can do that for you.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ef20bd3543c15100a0c6"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8870#issuecomment-12106167"}
