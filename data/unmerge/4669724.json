Just saying you use a different font for singletons, doesn't change how everyone would read that. \r\n\r\nIt's a well accepted convention that methods with a ? will return a true or false boolean value, not just work in an if statement.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of the following:\r\n\r\n    def value\r\n       \"Something\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def value?\r\n       !!value\r\n    end\r\n\r\nIn the example you're suggesting, the later method should never exist, because I can quite easily do:\r\n\r\n    if value\r\n\r\nAnd it will just work.\r\n\r\nI'm with @kneath on this anyway, what's the problem? Will it cause a performance issue? The 2.3 method is more flexible, and restoring it will prevent confusion when people upgrade.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e216"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4669724", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4669724", "updated_at": "2012-03-23T23:15:53Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis", "login": "vertis", "gravatar_id": "b2a9e57c2a8ed757833b4c787b6c51d5", "html_url": "https://github.com/vertis", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b2a9e57c2a8ed757833b4c787b6c51d5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84e17d99a1e885b374d0cb2e25d7aa4b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 19705, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-23T23:15:53Z", "id": 4669724, "owner": "rails"}
