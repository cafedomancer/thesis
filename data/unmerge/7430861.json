This WILL fail for floats, when you're least expecting it. For instance:\n\n```ruby\n(1.1-0.9) % 0.2 # => 5.551115123125783e-17\n```\n\nSee [the ruby-talk FAQ](https://github.com/rdp/ruby_tutorials_core/wiki/ruby-talk-faq#wiki-floats_imprecise) or your favorite numerical methods text for further details. The TL;DR is that exact comparison of floats is bad mojo.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fe2cbd3543c15100bcab"}, "issue_id": 7216, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7430861", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7216#issuecomment-7430861", "updated_at": "2012-08-01T15:43:03Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr", "login": "al2o3cr", "gravatar_id": "6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243", "html_url": "https://github.com/al2o3cr", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6883e5ef03484d4fcef507d7b4f1d243?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fb20bb95ab626d93fd976af958fbc61ba.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1191, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/al2o3cr/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-01T15:43:03Z", "id": 7430861, "owner": "rails"}
