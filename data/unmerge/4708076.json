{"body": "@vertis yes, telling it is my code base is a just a way to say it is not the OP's code base, or your code base. I belong to a *team* and of course Rails is not mine. That goes without saying. And the team already has a policy about how to write predicates. That's why almost all the API documents predicates as generic predicates. There some exceptions documenting singletons, but a little inconsistency is normal in a large code base.\r\n\r\nThat PR is not about `xhr?`, is about a project policy. We are not going to special-case this particular predicate. And we are not going to change the project policy.\r\n\r\nI don't claim returning singletons is wrong.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the revert are explained in the commit message. There is **nothing to fix**. Do you understand that? Nothing to fix! The current predicate is just fine!\r\n\r\nYou would like to have it in a different way? I totally respect that.\r\n\r\nMy attitude is respectful, patient, and polite. I am pretty confident about that.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4708076", "created_at": "2012-03-27T01:29:00Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4708076", "updated_at": "2012-03-27T01:30:11Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5580, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "fxn", "type": "User", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd42"}, "id": 4708076, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5580"}
