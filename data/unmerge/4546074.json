{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5460", "repo": "rails", "body": "Also, regarding instance_eval hijacking self and making people confused when a method that should be in scope raises a NoMethodError, this wouldn't be a problem in this situation. with_options yields an ActiveSupport::OptionMerger.new(self), which is sort of like a BasicObject that delegates all missing methods to its first parameter (the receiver of with_options). So even though I do agree with you on instance_eval in principal, in this specific situation it wouldn't cause any weird NoMethodErrors. The only problem would be if you used instance variables in the scope... which would be kinda rare, but I think I just talked myself out of the use of this commit... hahaha :D\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work, guys!", "_id": {"$oid": "523817c8bd3543c15100dfb6"}, "issue_id": 5460, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4546074", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5460#issuecomment-4546074", "updated_at": "2012-03-16T19:12:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru", "login": "luke-gru", "gravatar_id": "349d851184514340f1757f3a71b6807a", "html_url": "https://github.com/luke-gru", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/349d851184514340f1757f3a71b6807a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa7e1d7d3049ac5512f00c12e92dae760.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 500554, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/luke-gru/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-16T19:06:37Z", "id": 4546074, "owner": "rails"}
