I don't need to add a `-n` flag since the page will fill up eventually. and I don't need to specify which log to tail since only the one of interest should fill the screen.\r\n\r\nLike @hkarthik said, adding another rake task means more overhead. Most typical rails apps will have a list that is more than the size of the screen when invoking `rake -T` so this just adds another one.\r\n\r\n@scottvrosenthal, I can understand your point with something that this may be something people do frequently. And yes, you are correct, it's not easy to infer the rails environment without doing some magic. However, like I said before, this is one line. And it's one line that's not even cross-platform compatible. If it's something that's really desired then add it as a custom rake task to your project. If you don't like copying it across all your projects then create a gem. ", "_id": {"$oid": "52383163bd3543c15100f74f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3802#issuecomment-2984852"}
