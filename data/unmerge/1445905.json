{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1846", "repo": "rails", "body": "Hi Andrew,\r\nI've looked at our production environment again and I know now what is going wrong.\r\nSomehow AR::Dirty tracking is comparing marshalled data with unmarshalled data, which is off course always different, causing an update to the session. I am working on reproducing this with a test, but I am beginning to suspect that Rails passes the session to Rack, Rack calls ActiveRecord.save on the session, which is marhalled before save. Somehow, in Rack it is now dirty because of the marshal, and it is saved because of this.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384d5fbd3543c1510114df"}, "issue_id": 1846, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1445905", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1846#issuecomment-1445905", "updated_at": "2011-06-27T10:26:19Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke", "login": "barttenbrinke", "gravatar_id": "a49172d1ddae42fa062770b59823c01d", "html_url": "https://github.com/barttenbrinke", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/a49172d1ddae42fa062770b59823c01d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F313e98866f7643ecdbf07e2ba4cfc55b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 8935, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-27T08:30:03Z", "id": 1445905, "owner": "rails"}
