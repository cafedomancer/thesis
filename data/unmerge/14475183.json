Either way, I'd be happy as long as I can remove the welcome page route.\r\n\r\n> Instead it would be the same amount of work to add a route helper method for users of your CMS to the config/routes.rb file. Something like:\r\n>     mount_cms\r\n> That would only over-write that one route for the root.\r\n\r\nIs there a supported way to selectively remove an existing route? I can't override the route with another one since the home page needs to be rendered by the middleware which is run after the Rails routes.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1bd9bd354364b9004bb3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9575#issuecomment-14475183"}
