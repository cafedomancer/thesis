{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9575", "repo": "rails", "body": "> For your CMS to now work with a Rails app the developer must add this line of code to their app\r\n\r\nThis option would be set by the CMS engine.\r\n\r\n> they also lose some non trivial pages such as /rails/info/routes which is unexpected.\r\n\r\nThese other pages are just used by the welcome page aren't they? Either way, I'd be happy as long as I can remove the welcome page route.\r\n\r\n> Instead it would be the same amount of work to add a route helper method for users of your CMS to the config/routes.rb file. Something like:\r\n>     mount_cms\r\n> That would only over-write that one route for the root.\r\n\r\nIs there a supported way to selectively remove an existing route? I can't override the route with another one since the home page needs to be rendered by the middleware which is run after the Rails routes.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d1bd9bd354364b9004bb3"}, "issue_id": 9575, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14475183", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9575#issuecomment-14475183", "updated_at": "2013-03-06T00:34:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spohlenz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spohlenz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spohlenz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spohlenz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/spohlenz", "login": "spohlenz", "gravatar_id": "43da0307752bf635c44c33dcdd962a2e", "html_url": "https://github.com/spohlenz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spohlenz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spohlenz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spohlenz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/43da0307752bf635c44c33dcdd962a2e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd397c2b2be2178fe6247bd50fc97cff2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spohlenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 7600, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/spohlenz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-06T00:34:12Z", "id": 14475183, "owner": "rails"}
