Its just something I'm thinking about at the moment as I'm supposed to be adding v6 to a staging server next week. Its also not one of those things you can easily test in development mode as pow and passenger currently only listen on v4.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384fc7bd3543c151011671"}, "issue_id": 1758, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1393467", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1758#issuecomment-1393467", "updated_at": "2011-06-18T14:27:52Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffgarside/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffgarside/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffgarside/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffgarside/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffgarside", "login": "geoffgarside", "gravatar_id": "4dcfd2f7d671af330bcba3fe03277c71", "html_url": "https://github.com/geoffgarside", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffgarside/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffgarside/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffgarside/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4dcfd2f7d671af330bcba3fe03277c71?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F81c2f886f91e18fe16d6f4e865877cb6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffgarside/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2704, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/geoffgarside/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-18T14:27:52Z", "id": 1393467, "owner": "rails"}
