Its just something I'm thinking about at the moment as I'm supposed to be adding v6 to a staging server next week. Its also not one of those things you can easily test in development mode as pow and passenger currently only listen on v4.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384fc7bd3543c151011671"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1758#issuecomment-1393467"}
