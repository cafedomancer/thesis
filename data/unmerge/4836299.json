I'll see if I can capture the behavior I'm seeing in a test tomorrow. Giving your test a quick look, I don't see why we seem to be experiencing slightly different behavior. You explicitly set layout to false in your test case, and I conditionally do the same thing on non-html requests:\r\n\r\n````ruby\r\nlayout ->(controller) { controller.request.format.html? ? 'some_layout_file' : false }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I examine what the `_layout` call actually returns in your patched `ActionController::Caching::Actions::ActionCacheFilter#filter`, I get:\r\n\r\n````ruby\r\nRails.logger.debug \"#{controller.send(:_layout).class.name}\"\r\n# -> FalseClass\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo being an instance of `FalseClass` and not `NilClass`, `!controller.send(:_layout).nil?` evaluates to `true` and the patch fails to prevent the controller from trying to wrap cache hits in a layout.\r\n\r\nI'll re-examine tomorrow, not sure why your test passes by checking `nil` and my implementation requires checking `false`.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819c6bd3543c15100e25e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5328#issuecomment-4836299"}
