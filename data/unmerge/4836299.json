Giving your test a quick look, I don't see why we seem to be experiencing slightly different behavior. You explicitly set layout to false in your test case, and I conditionally do the same thing on non-html requests:\r\n\r\n````ruby\r\nlayout ->(controller) { controller.request.format.html? ? 'some_layout_file' : false }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I examine what the `_layout` call actually returns in your patched `ActionController::Caching::Actions::ActionCacheFilter#filter`, I get:\r\n\r\n````ruby\r\nRails.logger.debug \"#{controller.send(:_layout).class.name}\"\r\n# -> FalseClass\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo being an instance of `FalseClass` and not `NilClass`, `!controller.send(:_layout).nil?` evaluates to `true` and the patch fails to prevent the controller from trying to wrap cache hits in a layout.\r\n\r\nI'll re-examine tomorrow, not sure why your test passes by checking `nil` and my implementation requires checking `false`.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819c6bd3543c15100e25e"}, "issue_id": 5328, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4836299", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5328#issuecomment-4836299", "updated_at": "2012-03-30T04:45:07Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh", "login": "nmertaugh", "gravatar_id": "284876426d47fdcddfe1c44ad125bb55", "html_url": "https://github.com/nmertaugh", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/284876426d47fdcddfe1c44ad125bb55?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F78d49e641fbcdebe7a2d0cfad1788b0a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 836301, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nmertaugh/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-30T04:45:07Z", "id": 4836299, "owner": "rails"}
