{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10244", "repo": "rails", "body": "> But railties are called 'railties,' not plugins... I didn't even know you could generate railties. o_O\r\n\r\nI don't follow the argument here. Railties and engines are both kinds of plugins.\r\nAn apple is still called apple, it doesn't stop it from being a fruit. :P\r\n\r\n> `rails/railties/bin/rails plugin --help | grep railtie` doesn't match anything, so I assume that there isn't a generator for railties\r\n\r\nYes, you are right. In fact, the generated plugin by default is neither an engine nor a railtie. This is because to extend Rails, you don't need any of them upfront. They are both an implementation detail. When you need some particular features in your plugin, you upgrade it to Railtie or, depending on the features, you upgrade it to an engine. Railtie and Engine are implementation details. When you generate a model, do you invoke `rails g activerecord` (the implementation) or `rails g model` (what you want to achieve)?\r\n\r\nIn any case, it is good you mentioned the help, because the `rails engine --help` in this proposal would point directly to the `rails plugin new --help`, which could cause a lot of confusion.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e156bd3543c151008f88"}, "issue_id": 10244, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16486278", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10244#issuecomment-16486278", "updated_at": "2013-04-17T04:27:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-04-17T04:26:58Z", "id": 16486278, "owner": "rails"}
