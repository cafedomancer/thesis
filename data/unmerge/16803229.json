Changed Active Model validations to support more than  one context.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def valid?(context = nil)\r\n      current_context = validation_context\r\n      errors.clear\r\n      ctxs = Array.wrap(context)\r\n\r\n      ctxs.each do |ctx|\r\n        self.validation_context = ctx\r\n        run_validations!\r\n      end\r\n    ensure\r\n      self.validation_context = current_context\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then chagned Active Record validations to pass two contexts.\r\n\r\n```\r\n      #context ||= (new_record? ? :create : :update)\r\n      context ||= (new_record? ? [:create, :save] : [:update, :save])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue now is that for `User.new.valid?` the error messages are happening twice because `validates :name, presence: true` does not put any if condition and thus both `:create` and `:save` fires the validation logic.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix that would be to assume that `validates :name, presence: true` is same as `validates :name, presence: true, on: :save` .  Now all the validation logics are bound to save explicitly. But that makes Active Modal aware of `:save` .
