I don't think it is a good idea to push code, docs, and tests to maintain if the feature ends up being dubious. If people want to play with something experimental better a plugin than a black hole in the code base hidden by a flag to the end user.\r\n\r\nI mean, we are touching one of the strongest conventions in Rails, it touches the blessed actions. We have to do that with extra care in my view.\r\n\r\nIf I had to bet, I'd say go, but I'd prefer to have a clear understanding of the convenience of pushing this from someone as Roy Fielding, given nobody in the thread AFAICT seems to have a definitive authoritative answer. Because pushing support for PATCH has implications, it sends a message to the user base. The guide and blog post need to explain to users when or why they should use PATCH, and from this thread we have no conclusions. A blog post saying \"in case you want it, why? we don't really know, you just have it there, use at your risk, have fun\" doesn't sound right to me.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012114"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-2773544"}
