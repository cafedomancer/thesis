I think headers might be better because to me whether something is being replaced or just modified isn't a yes/no question when metadata is considered.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012120"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3149322", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3149322", "updated_at": "2011-12-14T21:01:05Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin", "login": "benatkin", "gravatar_id": "70b0265140eaff6e312eb3efcff3c195", "html_url": "https://github.com/benatkin", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/70b0265140eaff6e312eb3efcff3c195?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84f74ce4511e0c9531af1182fb636f0f.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4126, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-14T20:54:36Z", "id": 3149322, "owner": "rails"}
