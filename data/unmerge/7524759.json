That is, if the string uses spaces, it unindents as many spaces as needed, and the same goes with tabs. That is, as long as the string uses either spaces or tabs for indentation. If you mix them, then whatever happens is undefined.\n\nThis patch goes beyond indentation removal, it inserts indentation. I believe that for it to be complete it should also understand both styles out of the box.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fdc7bd3543c15100bba9"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7263#issuecomment-7524759"}
