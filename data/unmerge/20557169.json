You get feedback and make some changes *without* committing them locally. At this point. You can do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git commit --amend\r\n$ git push --force\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will update your own fork's `master` branch and the PR will be updated in the `rails/rails` repo.\r\n\r\nAnother scenario, you have more than one commit in a PR and you are asked to squash them into a single commit. This is where you follow @steveklabnik's post: http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-11-08-how-to-squash-commits-in-a-github-pull-request.\r\n\r\nYou should never have to create a separate PR request unless you *really* messed up your rebase.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d625bd3543c151008288"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11326#issuecomment-20557169"}
