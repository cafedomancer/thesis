You get feedback and make some changes *without* committing them locally. At this point. You can do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git commit --amend\r\n$ git push --force\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will update your own fork's `master` branch and the PR will be updated in the `rails/rails` repo.\r\n\r\nAnother scenario, you have more than one commit in a PR and you are asked to squash them into a single commit. This is where you follow @steveklabnik's post: http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-11-08-how-to-squash-commits-in-a-github-pull-request.\r\n\r\nYou should never have to create a separate PR request unless you *really* messed up your rebase.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d625bd3543c151008288"}, "issue_id": 11326, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20557169", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11326#issuecomment-20557169", "updated_at": "2013-07-06T16:51:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges", "login": "mattdbridges", "gravatar_id": "fa4b5f21ddfec459b530bfce99079e54", "html_url": "https://github.com/mattdbridges", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/fa4b5f21ddfec459b530bfce99079e54?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f3da53df1c3935c37f47ffbc13d554b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 442443, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-06T16:51:04Z", "id": 20557169, "owner": "rails"}
