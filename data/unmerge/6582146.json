Engine's routes don't know anything about the way the engine is mounted. In other words you need to call router from the host, typically main application, to generate such route.\n\nIf this is an engine that is rather mounted only in your app, you could use `main_app` helper, like `main_app.url_for(:omg => \"something\")`. If this is an engine that's more generic and you expect that it could be mounted in other engine, you could allow to configure the name of the helper (so you can use something else than `main_app`).\n\nI will leave this open for a while, in case someone has any idea on better way to do it, but I think it's a \"won't fix\"", "_id": {"$oid": "5238029fbd3543c15100c32b"}, "issue_id": 6854, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6582146", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6854#issuecomment-6582146", "updated_at": "2012-06-26T17:25:35Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus", "login": "drogus", "gravatar_id": "582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30", "html_url": "https://github.com/drogus", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3202111cf90e7c816a472aaceb72b0df.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5004, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-26T17:25:35Z", "id": 6582146, "owner": "rails"}
