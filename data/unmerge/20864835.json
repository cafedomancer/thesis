As said before I think raising is the right thing to do. Regarding your example with polymorphism I really don't think this is a good thing to do. Polymorphism means that you treat all your objects as if they \"were\" a `Story`. This means you can't make assumptions that are only true for certain subclasses, when you deal with the genreal `Story` type. Otherwise many things will eventually break.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237daa9bd3543c151008731"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10912#issuecomment-20864835"}
