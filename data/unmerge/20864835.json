Regarding your example with polymorphism I really don't think this is a good thing to do. Polymorphism means that you treat all your objects as if they \"were\" a `Story`. This means you can't make assumptions that are only true for certain subclasses, when you deal with the genreal `Story` type. Otherwise many things will eventually break.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237daa9bd3543c151008731"}, "issue_id": 10912, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20864835", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10912#issuecomment-20864835", "updated_at": "2013-07-12T08:39:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "login": "senny", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-12T08:39:32Z", "id": 20864835, "owner": "rails"}
