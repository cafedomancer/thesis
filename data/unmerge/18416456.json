{"body": "Thanks @vipulnsward ... I made a comment there asking if this will be backported to other Rails versions.  I also confirmed that your fix does indeed fix our issue in both MRI (p429) and in JRuby (on 1.9.3-p392 [jruby 1.7.4], which surprisingly *doesn't* fail on MRI p392, even though it does on MRI p429!).
