Storing digests and checking on subsequent compile is great.\r\n\r\nGenerating non-digest assets from possibly-existing digests assets feels like it may be a step too far though. It's bolted on and needs some serious digging to strip digest URLs. I think it'd be better to omit.\r\n\r\nI'd really rather see non-digest assets go away entirely -- much simpler :)\r\n\r\nAlso, this makes a handful of breaking changes: renaming `config.assets.digests`, renaming related methods, making some methods private, etc. I think the change can be made less intrusively, without changing methods or breaking any current apps, but it'd mean introducing a second manifest of source digests rather than changing the existing manifest at all.", "_id": {"$oid": "523dc1f1bd354364b9009bf6"}, "issue_id": 7866, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9204732", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7866#issuecomment-9204732", "updated_at": "2012-10-07T03:20:44Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy", "login": "jeremy", "gravatar_id": "24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremy", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84d9ee44e457ddef7f2c4f25dc8fa865.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 199, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-07T03:20:44Z", "id": 9204732, "owner": "rails"}
