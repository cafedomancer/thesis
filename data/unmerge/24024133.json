I've noticed several things:\r\n\r\n* I think that the main README file should be updated since it states that models derived from `ActiveRecord::Base`, this is still true but not completely. The `RDOC_MAIN.rdoc` files should be updated as well in each project.\r\n* All the guides should be updated (mainly all the ActiveRecord ones and \"Getting started with Rails\"). Also, I think that we should mention the motivation behind the existence of this new class in the \"Active Record Basics\" guide.\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to ping me if you want some help. :smiley: Thank you!", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ce86bd3543c151007a64"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12162#issuecomment-24024133"}
