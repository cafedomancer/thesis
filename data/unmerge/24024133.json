{"body": "Awesome pull request, thank you! I've noticed several things:\r\n\r\n* I think that the main README file should be updated since it states that models derived from `ActiveRecord::Base`, this is still true but not completely. The `RDOC_MAIN.rdoc` files should be updated as well in each project.\r\n* All the guides should be updated (mainly all the ActiveRecord ones and \"Getting started with Rails\"). Also, I think that we should mention the motivation behind the existence of this new class in the \"Active Record Basics\" guide.\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to ping me if you want some help. :smiley: Thank you!", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/24024133", "created_at": "2013-09-08T16:35:59Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12162#issuecomment-24024133", "updated_at": "2013-09-08T16:35:59Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 12162, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/robin850", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/2d27b53e2eeb6a053552332020628029?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fafc5fd60924eb324ae549e95c93f0643.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2d27b53e2eeb6a053552332020628029", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "robin850", "type": "User", "id": 354185, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/robin850/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ce86bd3543c151007a64"}, "id": 24024133, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/12162"}
