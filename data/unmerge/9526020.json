The current generator understands the `GUIDES_LANGUAGE` environment variable. If you have _source/es_ and you set the variable to \"es\", then the sources are picked up from that folder, and the output generated in _output/es_.\r\n\r\nYour patch adds a language structure to the repository that we do not want. The example with URLs wanted to compare that use case with the directory structure. Since Rails itself only supports English, there is no need to create an explicit folder structure for locales.\r\n\r\nInstead, there is an implicit structure to at least give a way for people to work on their local translations easily.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f72dbd3543c15100afc0"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7974#issuecomment-9526020"}
