If you lose them, it is trivial to recreate them.\r\n\r\nGit repositories are opaque to a lot of developers.

But there's more work to pruning a git repository than there is to recompiling assets.\r\n\r\nSo it seems to me that the lesser evil is to ignore precompiled assets by default.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383ed6bd3543c15101061a"}, "issue_id": 2817, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3266758", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2817#issuecomment-3266758", "updated_at": "2011-12-24T06:26:47Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sheldonh/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sheldonh/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sheldonh/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sheldonh/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sheldonh", "login": "sheldonh", "gravatar_id": "747b0480986bd8ac5d91aafd74bea043", "html_url": "https://github.com/sheldonh", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sheldonh/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sheldonh/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sheldonh/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/747b0480986bd8ac5d91aafd74bea043?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fcf7f5d18c19536b2299bd648d5028f0c.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sheldonh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 45098, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sheldonh/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-24T06:26:47Z", "id": 3266758, "owner": "rails"}
