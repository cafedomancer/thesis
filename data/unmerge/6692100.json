There are 4 commits and only one commit actually fixing anything. If you want to fix this, you could create new branch from master and just cherry-pick this commit.\n2. This is not backwards compatible, if I do: `Post.select(my_proc)` it will brake. Of course I could do `&my_proc`, but we can't assume that there is no former version of this code.\n\nOther than that, @jonleighton @tenderlove: are you ok with such change getting into master?", "_id": {"$oid": "523801fdbd3543c15100c246"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6916#issuecomment-6692100"}
