{"body": "Thanks for the patch, but there are 2 problems here:\n\n1. There are 4 commits and only one commit actually fixing anything. If you want to fix this, you could create new branch from master and just cherry-pick this commit.\n2. This is not backwards compatible, if I do: `Post.select(my_proc)` it will brake. Of course I could do `&my_proc`, but we can't assume that there is no former version of this code.\n\nOther than that, @jonleighton @tenderlove: are you ok with such change getting into master?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6692100", "created_at": "2012-07-01T09:00:52Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6916#issuecomment-6692100", "updated_at": "2012-07-01T09:00:52Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6916, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/drogus", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3202111cf90e7c816a472aaceb72b0df.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/received_events", "gravatar_id": "582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "drogus", "type": "User", "id": 5004, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523801fdbd3543c15100c246"}, "id": 6692100, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6916"}
