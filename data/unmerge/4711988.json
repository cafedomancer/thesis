{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5580", "repo": "rails", "body": "@josevalim my apologies to you.. but since he said he \"talked to the core team\" at a time when very few of them could possibly be available (and you, being in the same country as him, are one of the ones who could have been available at the time.. anyone in the US or Canada would have most likely been asleep or just waking up to start their day), I assumed he must have talked to you. My bad, I'm sorry for jumping to that conclusion and I probably shouldn't have assumed that.\r\n\r\nYou personally, I have nothing but respect for, and honestly I was shocked at the thought that you were \"doing his dirty work\" but that's certainly how his comment, and the timing of this pull request being closed, made it appear. Still, I was wrong to make that assumption without facts just based on the appearance and timing of everything and the general attitude he has displayed throughout this entire discussion.", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd48"}, "issue_id": 5580, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4711988", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4711988", "updated_at": "2012-03-27T08:28:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512", "login": "stevenh512", "gravatar_id": "b3e25a674fe385ec5d985c8adf8d60aa", "html_url": "https://github.com/stevenh512", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b3e25a674fe385ec5d985c8adf8d60aa?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Feb5bc262e55ae62defb5de04c8848a90.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 110500, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-27T08:28:29Z", "id": 4711988, "owner": "rails"}
