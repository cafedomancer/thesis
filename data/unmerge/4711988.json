My bad, I'm sorry for jumping to that conclusion and I probably shouldn't have assumed that.\r\n\r\nYou personally, I have nothing but respect for, and honestly I was shocked at the thought that you were \"doing his dirty work\" but that's certainly how his comment, and the timing of this pull request being closed, made it appear. Still, I was wrong to make that assumption without facts just based on the appearance and timing of everything and the general attitude he has displayed throughout this entire discussion.", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd48"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4711988"}
