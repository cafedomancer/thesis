{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7866", "repo": "rails", "body": "@ndbroadbent I agree with @jeremy I would like to see non-digested files go away entirely.\r\n\r\nWith the beginnings of work I have started in #5379 removing everything else in the public directory and generating them at compile time is much preferred in my eyes. \r\n\r\nA nondigest manifest would be a good addition to cut down the generation time even further. However, adding a manifest removes one of the biggest benefits of the asset pipeline. That repository histories are not bloated by loads of \"bundling, jammit whatever.\" commits. So it should definitely be optional.\r\n\r\nNot having to generate non-digest variants as a starter, would cut the processing time down by 50% and also remove what IMHO is a pretty complicated (and hacky) approach to reset the rake env to do the nondigest compile.\r\n\r\nThe final issue I'm wrestling with in #5379 is making sprockets understand the files in /public. The problem here is that sprockets is mounted to `/assets` and the non-digest files we care about are `public/404.html` etc.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523dc1f1bd354364b9009bfa"}, "issue_id": 7866, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9306107", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7866#issuecomment-9306107", "updated_at": "2012-10-10T14:58:56Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice", "login": "davidjrice", "gravatar_id": "71f4402df3b4cdc8230e9922d3c5af32", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidjrice", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/71f4402df3b4cdc8230e9922d3c5af32?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fde73998802680548b916f1947ffbad76.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1971, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidjrice/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-10T14:58:56Z", "id": 9306107, "owner": "rails"}
