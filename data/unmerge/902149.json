With a room of 20 rails devs at railscamp we had a decent quantity who expressed surprise when Ryan pointed out that you shouldn't be using the current generators as a day to day development tool.\r\n\r\nCertainly my experience shows that people are using it in business quite a lot. I've seen quite a few cases where the explicit commenting of routes above the methods has become the documentation standard throughout the app.\r\n\r\nIt's my belief that it's being used pretty heavily as something other than a learning tool, but I can't really prove it. \r\n\r\nCheers.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238651abd3543c1510126ac"}, "issue_id": 233, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/902149", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/233#issuecomment-902149", "updated_at": "2011-03-22T09:19:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Breccan/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Breccan/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Breccan/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Breccan/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Breccan", "login": "Breccan", "gravatar_id": "b7083eefdbc828379d5dc090a7a77a51", "html_url": "https://github.com/Breccan", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Breccan/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Breccan/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Breccan/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b7083eefdbc828379d5dc090a7a77a51?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F647eb89e04e05801979246bd0d2ec15b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Breccan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 27055, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Breccan/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-03-22T09:19:15Z", "id": 902149, "owner": "rails"}
