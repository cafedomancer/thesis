{"body": "@al2o3cr Oh, indeed, Rails doesn't require all the migrations. So it would be nice to accept a string/symbol and load it for you, I guess, like `revert :tenderlove_migration` (or equivalently `revert '012345678_tenderlove_migration'`). I'll amend the request when I get a chance.\n\n@rafaelfranca I proposed `revert` because the rest is imperative, `def change`, `add_column`, etc... I think the following read very well:\n\n    def change\n       add_column :my_table, :whatever, :string\n       revert { add_column :other_table, :whatever, :string }\n    end\n\nDoesn't `reverted` sound like it will return something reverted instead of actually doing something?\n\nIn any case, we could also have both aliased :-)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8536474", "created_at": "2012-09-13T17:38:45Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7280#issuecomment-8536474", "updated_at": "2012-09-13T17:38:45Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7280, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/marcandre", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b06d8e26b92456b228d3c77b66397534?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b48ea597d2862688e4aa8a2b28651a3.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/received_events", "gravatar_id": "b06d8e26b92456b228d3c77b66397534", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "marcandre", "type": "User", "id": 33770, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fd99bd3543c15100bb7b"}, "id": 8536474, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7280"}
