So it would be nice to accept a string/symbol and load it for you, I guess, like `revert :tenderlove_migration` (or equivalently `revert '012345678_tenderlove_migration'`). I'll amend the request when I get a chance.\n\n@rafaelfranca I proposed `revert` because the rest is imperative, `def change`, `add_column`, etc... I think the following read very well:\n\n    def change\n       add_column :my_table, :whatever, :string\n       revert { add_column :other_table, :whatever, :string }\n    end\n\nDoesn't `reverted` sound like it will return something reverted instead of actually doing something?\n\nIn any case, we could also have both aliased :-)", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fd99bd3543c15100bb7b"}, "issue_id": 7280, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8536474", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7280#issuecomment-8536474", "updated_at": "2012-09-13T17:38:45Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre", "login": "marcandre", "gravatar_id": "b06d8e26b92456b228d3c77b66397534", "html_url": "https://github.com/marcandre", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b06d8e26b92456b228d3c77b66397534?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b48ea597d2862688e4aa8a2b28651a3.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 33770, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/marcandre/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-13T17:38:45Z", "id": 8536474, "owner": "rails"}
