Here, it's hard to see where that would be the case, particularly because it's just a rearrangement of the same syntax in a different order.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I feel it is unnatural to expect an object to know what other objects point at it. An Array is by definition a collection of references to other objects. Those objects can be referred to by an arbitrary number of other objects (such as Arrays) without their own state changing in any way.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be useful for someone (@sikachu, @dhh) to show an example of where `object.in?(hash)` is particularly more expressive than `hash.include?(object)`?", "_id": {"$oid": "52386422bd3543c151012593"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/258#issuecomment-981229"}
