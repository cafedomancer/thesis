{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6685", "repo": "rails", "body": "@tenderlove Agreed. I just wish we start doing our due diligence now, possibly backporting the latest thread safety fixes to 3-2-stable so we can try it out now. Based on my previous experience with `config.threadsafe!`, there were bugs related to autoload even in production mode where we eager load most of the stuff. Development mode uses another strategy for code loading, which may have even more thread-related bugs (I have no idea what will happen if two threads try to autoload the same constant at the same time via AS::Dependencies). Besides autoload I am also aware of issues in the resolver and possibly in the connection pool.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c6f0"}, "issue_id": 6685, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6253401", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6253401", "updated_at": "2012-06-11T19:27:22Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-11T19:21:56Z", "id": 6253401, "owner": "rails"}
