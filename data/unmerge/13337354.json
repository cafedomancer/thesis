If it's an array, then it won't be constant time since Array#== does bail out. In any case I don't think we can rely on either of them being constant time because they could change at any time. Plus...creating an Enumerator is additional object overhead we don't need.\r\n\r\nI think the fourth version I posted, with |= and ^, should be constant time for all inputs and should not create any objects in any mainstream Ruby implementation.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ebebbd3543c151009bf2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9230#issuecomment-13337354"}
