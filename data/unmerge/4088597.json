But we have some topics to discuss before we get to the final implementation. A few things:\r\n\r\n1) We should not hardcode to app/models. In fact, all engines have a config.paths[\"app/models\"] that returns an array with model related paths. We should probably rely on this;\r\n\r\n2) This is not related to your patch but your blog post. I believe it would be better for you to use require_dependency instead of require. Just in case to allow it to play well with development;\r\n\r\nThat said, what do you think about having a method called `require_dependency` on the engine?\r\n\r\n    MyEngine::Engine.require_dependency \"invitation\"\r\n\r\nThis would loop through all engine load paths ([they are available here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/engine.rb#L653)), find the file that matches and require it. I believe there is already methods in AS that can do the looping for us, but if not, it should be trivial to add it.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c95bd3543c15100e4ed"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5120#issuecomment-4088597"}
