{"body": "Thanks for the pull request, I like the general idea. But we have some topics to discuss before we get to the final implementation. A few things:\r\n\r\n1) We should not hardcode to app/models. In fact, all engines have a config.paths[\"app/models\"] that returns an array with model related paths. We should probably rely on this;\r\n\r\n2) This is not related to your patch but your blog post. I believe it would be better for you to use require_dependency instead of require. Just in case to allow it to play well with development;\r\n\r\nThat said, what do you think about having a method called `require_dependency` on the engine?\r\n\r\n    MyEngine::Engine.require_dependency \"invitation\"\r\n\r\nThis would loop through all engine load paths ([they are available here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/engine.rb#L653)), find the file that matches and require it. I believe there is already methods in AS that can do the looping for us, but if not, it should be trivial to add it.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4088597", "created_at": "2012-02-21T20:56:36Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5120#issuecomment-4088597", "updated_at": "2012-02-21T20:56:36Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5120, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c95bd3543c15100e4ed"}, "id": 4088597, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5120"}
