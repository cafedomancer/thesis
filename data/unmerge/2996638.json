There are certainly dragons involved to be sure, but from a readability standpoint it's hard to argue that:\r\n\r\n    my_array.safe_join\r\n\r\nlooks a heckuva lot better than:\r\n\r\n    ActiveSupport::SafeArray.new(my_array).join\r\n\r\nConsidering how much I personally need this, I'd hate to have to do option number 2 everywhere I needed it in my code.  Even if `#join` was a public class method, it would help, but not by much.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of \"Just Work\"ing I have to admit I like the idea of an additional method.  If ActiveSupport didn't monkey-patch core objects _at all_ then there would be a stronger case for not doing it here.\r\n\r\nJust saw this PR and thought I'd add my 2 cents for what it's worth. :)  Thanks for looking into this!", "_id": {"$oid": "523832b1bd3543c15100f8fa"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3716#issuecomment-2996638"}
