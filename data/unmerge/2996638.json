{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3716", "repo": "rails", "body": "-1 on monkey-patching `#join` but +1 on monkey-patching a new method.  There are certainly dragons involved to be sure, but from a readability standpoint it's hard to argue that:\r\n\r\n    my_array.safe_join\r\n\r\nlooks a heckuva lot better than:\r\n\r\n    ActiveSupport::SafeArray.new(my_array).join\r\n\r\nConsidering how much I personally need this, I'd hate to have to do option number 2 everywhere I needed it in my code.  Even if `#join` was a public class method, it would help, but not by much.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of \"Just Work\"ing I have to admit I like the idea of an additional method.  If ActiveSupport didn't monkey-patch core objects _at all_ then there would be a stronger case for not doing it here.\r\n\r\nJust saw this PR and thought I'd add my 2 cents for what it's worth. :)  Thanks for looking into this!", "_id": {"$oid": "523832b1bd3543c15100f8fa"}, "issue_id": 3716, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2996638", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3716#issuecomment-2996638", "updated_at": "2011-12-02T22:12:50Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfelchner/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfelchner/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfelchner/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfelchner/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfelchner", "login": "jfelchner", "gravatar_id": "f80fe9dc2c31f42d4ce72593fe559fd0", "html_url": "https://github.com/jfelchner", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfelchner/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfelchner/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfelchner/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f80fe9dc2c31f42d4ce72593fe559fd0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F622cd1be4868407407142700266607f0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfelchner/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 285582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jfelchner/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-02T22:12:50Z", "id": 2996638, "owner": "rails"}
