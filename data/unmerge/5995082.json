In my experience, AR got slower when 3.0 came out, 3.1 and 3.2 got faster (not only AR, but overall).\n\nI am ok with supporting Identity Map for those developers who want to, but it will get in for the right reasons. Not because some people are saying Rails is getting slower.\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523e4e93bd354364b900ee7a"}, "issue_id": 6524, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5995082", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6524#issuecomment-5995082", "updated_at": "2012-05-29T20:38:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-29T20:38:28Z", "id": 5995082, "owner": "rails"}
