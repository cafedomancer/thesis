In our case sometimes we have several qc, staging, training, development, production, etc. so rake tail would be a good shortcut.\r\n\r\nI'll change to use rake tail and resubmit to see what the consensus is then.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238316dbd3543c15100f76c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3801#issuecomment-2944687"}
