They mostly would be opening the file up in a text editor and then refresh the editor periodically. If they execute the rake tail, windows would just say command not found etc.\r\n\r\nEither way I find myself and others doing tail -f log/de<TAB> all over the place and yes that's not much, the problem is you got to remember the environment for each one. In our case sometimes we have several qc, staging, training, development, production, etc. so rake tail would be a good shortcut.\r\n\r\nI'll change to use rake tail and resubmit to see what the consensus is then.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238316dbd3543c15100f76c"}, "issue_id": 3801, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2944687", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3801#issuecomment-2944687", "updated_at": "2011-11-29T19:54:41Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal", "login": "scottvrosenthal", "gravatar_id": "6a54102d3af783bab96b14b59f25f8b0", "html_url": "https://github.com/scottvrosenthal", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/6a54102d3af783bab96b14b59f25f8b0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc02a484869d06f0d258fa58ce110ac8a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 507446, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/scottvrosenthal/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-29T19:54:41Z", "id": 2944687, "owner": "rails"}
