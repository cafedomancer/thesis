I suggest you create a small empty app and try adding namespaced models I'm pretty sure it will work out of the box as long as you follow the Rails naming conventions.\r\n\r\n1) Rails is following its conventions here, fire up the console and try running few experiments like this `'Abc::Xxx'.underscore` or `'abc/xxx'.camelize`.\r\n\r\n2) Don't do that, it should work correctly out of the box.\r\n\r\n3) `Module.autoload` isn't going to work with Rails' constant reloading in dev. mode as far as I know.\r\n\r\n4) Reloading gems in dev. mode via Rails's `ActiveSupport::Dependencies` is technically possible, but you'd have to be pretty intimate with its internals and configuration.
