{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/285", "repo": "rails", "body": "I guess I still don't see how that argument makes sense. \r\n\r\nThe bcrypt-ruby library that is being used ITSELF provides the option for setting the cost, so why not pass that along to the user?  \r\n\r\nIts not like the rails codebase is adding code just for the sake of adding code, or even to extend functionality of an existing library. This patch is simply exposing a setting option to the user that already exists in the bcrypt-ruby implementation. \r\n\r\nWhile I can't think of compelling reasons as the moment for increasing the cost, there are current reasons for decreasing the cost. Speed and response time being the biggest, especially for stateless systems doing authentication. I've lowered the cost factor on two projects doing auth for API usage with mobile devices where speed was a huge consideration. \r\n\r\nIn the future, as hardware capabilities increase, there will come a need to increase the cost/work factor as well. \r\n\r\n- Craig\r\n\r\nOn Apr 17, 2011, at 4:27 AM, dhh<reply@reply.github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> We don't pre-emptively add options to code until we have a good reason to and a strong use case. More code is more code. Also, this whole module is tiny. You could easily overwrite the 4-line #password= if you truly need to change something. So I'm closing this for now. Feel free to reopen if you come up with an incredibly compelling case that's backed by data showing how a different setting is necessary.\r\n> \r\n> -- \r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/285#issuecomment-1016167", "_id": {"$oid": "5238635abd3543c1510124ad"}, "issue_id": 285, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1016509", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/285#issuecomment-1016509", "updated_at": "2011-04-17T11:38:13Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur", "login": "cpjolicoeur", "gravatar_id": "cf8a610127d1108dfe67f673320b5fe5", "html_url": "https://github.com/cpjolicoeur", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/cf8a610127d1108dfe67f673320b5fe5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F19b650660b253761af189682e03501dd.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 863, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cpjolicoeur/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-17T11:38:13Z", "id": 1016509, "owner": "rails"}
