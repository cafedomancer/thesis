{"body": "This is my proposal for `#among?`:\r\n\r\n- `alias :either?, :among?`\r\n- Add `#neither?` as a opposite.\r\n\r\nSo in some context which you test against two items, you might consider `#either?` to be more fit on it. While for testing on 3 things or more you'd use `#among?` because it reads better instead.\r\n\r\nFor `#neither?`, the word actually means \"not the one nor the other of two people or things\" so I think it's a good fit.
