While for testing on 3 things or more you'd use `#among?` because it reads better instead.\r\n\r\nFor `#neither?`, the word actually means \"not the one nor the other of two people or things\" so I think it's a good fit. In the real english it's ok for you to have more than 2 items such as:\r\n\r\n   I'm neither tenderlove, DHH, nor josevalim.", "_id": {"$oid": "523863f1bd3543c151012535"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/265#issuecomment-993684"}
