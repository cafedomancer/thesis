While for testing on 3 things or more you'd use `#among?` because it reads better instead.\r\n\r\nFor `#neither?`, the word actually means \"not the one nor the other of two people or things\" so I think it's a good fit. In the real english it's ok for you to have more than 2 items such as:\r\n\r\n   I'm neither tenderlove, DHH, nor josevalim.", "_id": {"$oid": "523863f1bd3543c151012535"}, "issue_id": 265, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/993684", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/265#issuecomment-993684", "updated_at": "2011-04-13T04:36:35Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu", "login": "sikachu", "gravatar_id": "f1c4a3bb1606cc4a61711e61e2fe6146", "html_url": "https://github.com/sikachu", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f1c4a3bb1606cc4a61711e61e2fe6146?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a4526b1ec301744aba9526d78fcb2a6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4912, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-13T04:36:35Z", "id": 993684, "owner": "rails"}
