{"body": "> should postgres timestamps be mapped as timestamps or datetimes?\n\nI think they have to be mapped as datetimes, since we can't change the current behavior without any warnings\n\n> can both timestamp and datetime be used for time-zone data?\n\nAre you talking about the Ruby DateTime? If so it is used for time-zone data right now.\n\n> if there is a sql-data type, which is not recognized, how should I issue a warning? print to the stderr? I think you can have a table with a not supported datatype, as long as you don't access the field you should be fine. Should the warning be issued on access or when the column is created?\n\nI'm not sure about this one.
