It is only invalid within a double-quoted attribute value.\n\nWhen I return the string in a StringBuffer, I am stating that I do not want any further encoding on it before it is passed to the output stream. I trust it, as-is. However, when it is passed in an attribute value, it is tripped up by the implementation of the #tag method which chose to use double-quotes to delimit the value. The #tag method knows this implementation detail, and should be smart enough to not allow passed in values to cause unintended behavior.", "_id": {"$oid": "523ddb11bd354364b900abc9"}, "issue_id": 7611, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8512105", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7611#issuecomment-8512105", "updated_at": "2012-09-12T22:16:48Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuaflanagan/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuaflanagan/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuaflanagan/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuaflanagan/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuaflanagan", "login": "joshuaflanagan", "gravatar_id": "10adb7caa4eff9c02d244172bc8db6df", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshuaflanagan", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuaflanagan/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuaflanagan/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuaflanagan/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/10adb7caa4eff9c02d244172bc8db6df?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3592eda3e878dde5bc1bddde6ffabe36.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuaflanagan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 81455, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshuaflanagan/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-12T22:16:48Z", "id": 8512105, "owner": "rails"}
