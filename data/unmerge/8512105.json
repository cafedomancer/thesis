It is only invalid within a double-quoted attribute value.\n\nWhen I return the string in a StringBuffer, I am stating that I do not want any further encoding on it before it is passed to the output stream. I trust it, as-is. However, when it is passed in an attribute value, it is tripped up by the implementation of the #tag method which chose to use double-quotes to delimit the value.
