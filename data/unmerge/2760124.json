Even if it had the same status (Draft Standard), it wouldn't carry quite the same weight to me unless I saw an endorsement from Roy Fielding. The obsolete standard, 2068, doesn't count.\r\n\r\nHere's the [first thing I found while searching for a new comment by Roy Fielding on PATCH](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2009/it-is-okay-to-use-post):\r\n\r\n> PATCH is another option that, once it is sufficiently deployed, might be preferred over POST for sub-resource updates. However, we make these choices for a principled reason, not just because it seems RESTful. Ultimately, the methods should be chosen by the origin server and communicated somehow to the client via the media type or relationship processing rules. If the choice of method doesn\u2019t make any difference to the other components (i.e., neither client nor intermediaries gain any value by using PUT or PATCH over POST), then we should admit that it just doesn\u2019t matter to the architectural style.\r\n\r\nSo it sounds like we can be pretty RESTful without PATCH, and especially without PATCH as the default.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012109"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-2760124"}
