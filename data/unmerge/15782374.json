{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10047", "repo": "rails", "body": "@dmathieu I was thinking more along the lines of what @mbhnyc was thinking, where I don't persist any records which are duplicates. But it is a good point that maybe this functionality should be put into an association option.\r\n\r\nI'd say that this functionality should be added to the ``uniq`` option, since making a completely new option like ``uniq_on_create`` seems like overkill. Also, I think removing duplicates when the association is persisted is better than the current functionality of ``uniq``, since the current ``uniq`` will load everything from the join table and remove the records that were already seen.\r\n\r\nI'll go ahead and change the PR to do this.
