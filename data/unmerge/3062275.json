Because it is giving you lower level access to your activerecord data.  It is not so much of a higher abstraction (like a gem to make your model a tree, or auditing, or storing at attachment, etc.)  \r\n\r\nSo since it is giving you lower level access help you optimize, I think core is a good place.\r\n\r\nI still don't like the name pluck, because it has different meaning in enumerable (where objects are already instantiated).  And since they decided they will do 1 column, why not more?", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f644"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3062275"}
