{"body": "@chaffeqa Yes the Rails commit for pluck is very small and is limited to 1 value.\r\n\r\nThe kind of thing that valium (or pluck) does I think should be part of a regular activerecord adapter.  Because it is giving you lower level access to your activerecord data.  It is not so much of a higher abstraction (like a gem to make your model a tree, or auditing, or storing at attachment, etc.)  \r\n\r\nSo since it is giving you lower level access help you optimize, I think core is a good place.\r\n\r\nI still don't like the name pluck, because it has different meaning in enumerable (where objects are already instantiated).
