For example, say Parent declares a `has_one` relation to a Widget model for all children. The following seed data throws a table missing error (table named as Parent). \r\n\r\n    child1 = Child1.create(...)\r\n    child1.create_widget(...)\r\n    child2 = Child2.create(...)\r\n    child2.create_widget(...)\r\n\r\nWhere the following sequence works as expected. \r\n\r\n    child1 = Child1.create(...)\r\n    child2 = Child2.create(...)\r\n    child1.create_widget(...)\r\n    child2.create_widget(...)\r\n\r\nIf I monkey patch the `table_name` method in each Child model, both sequences work as expected.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385964bd3543c151011cee"}, "issue_id": 1333, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1881270", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1333#issuecomment-1881270", "updated_at": "2011-08-23T16:09:01Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philmill/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philmill/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philmill/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philmill/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/philmill", "login": "philmill", "gravatar_id": "2dba115f92a62291c6390b26ba615fd0", "html_url": "https://github.com/philmill", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philmill/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philmill/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philmill/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2dba115f92a62291c6390b26ba615fd0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fca210a6211cc03cb018d8987e731dad1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philmill/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 150527, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philmill/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-08-23T16:09:01Z", "id": 1881270, "owner": "rails"}
