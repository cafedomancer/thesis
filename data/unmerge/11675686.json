I can see applications making use of this feature but like @rafaelfranca and @guilleiguaran I don't think it should be a part of rails. This is something that can be easily added with a gem and should be available on demand and not by default.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the time and work you put into making rails better. You can always use the [Rails Core Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-core) to get feedback from the core team before implementing a PR. This can help you to get a feel if a particular feature should be in rails core or provided as a gem.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f1babd3543c15100a4b3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8602#issuecomment-11675686"}
