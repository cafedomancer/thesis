{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8602", "repo": "rails", "body": "@acesuares thanks for your work! I can see applications making use of this feature but like @rafaelfranca and @guilleiguaran I don't think it should be a part of rails. This is something that can be easily added with a gem and should be available on demand and not by default.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the time and work you put into making rails better. You can always use the [Rails Core Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-core) to get feedback from the core team before implementing a PR. This can help you to get a feel if a particular feature should be in rails core or provided as a gem.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f1babd3543c15100a4b3"}, "issue_id": 8602, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11675686", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8602#issuecomment-11675686", "updated_at": "2012-12-25T19:52:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "login": "senny", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-25T19:52:42Z", "id": 11675686, "owner": "rails"}
