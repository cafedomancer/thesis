Yes it makes git story dirty the same way, but it was a fix of something that was previously wrong. On the other hand, this one is more aesthetic: whether we leave the code with the new or old hash style, doesn't actually matter. We set the convention for the new hash style for all new code, but old code is going to be migrated as we touch them. Similar changes for code conventions, like adding spaces around `{}`, indenting `private/protected` blocks, and stuff like that, all end up as cosmetic.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ef46bd3543c15100a113"}, "issue_id": 8851, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12072527", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8851#issuecomment-12072527", "updated_at": "2013-01-09T23:22:26Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-09T23:22:26Z", "id": 12072527, "owner": "rails"}
