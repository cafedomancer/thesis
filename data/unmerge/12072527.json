{"body": "@tehgeekmeister That was actually fixing something, even though it was a minor typo. Yes it makes git story dirty the same way, but it was a fix of something that was previously wrong. On the other hand, this one is more aesthetic: whether we leave the code with the new or old hash style, doesn't actually matter.
