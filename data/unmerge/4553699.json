And by the way, in the application it may not be obvious which of the two situations apply. Since the loading can happen at some completely different place. This action at a distance has made my job in hunting this down a lot more difficult.\r\n\r\nIf we keep the current behavior, the implementation of the callback needs to check if the record is already in the association or if it is a really new record - which is short of yet another database lookup not quite so straightforward.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523ec1f2bd354364b9012710"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5476#issuecomment-4553699"}
