{"body": "@jpalermo Thank you for this patch!\n\nHow do you define a collation on a column in migration, though? Maybe I'm missing something, but I've been doing this:\n\n```SQL\nexecute 'ALTER TABLE users MODIFY `token` VARCHAR(32) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin'\n```\n\nWhile what I'd really like to do instead is:\n\n```ruby\ncreate_table :users do |t|\n  t.string :token, limit: 32, collation: 'utf8_bin'\nend\n```\n\nBut it doesn't seem possible.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6086443", "created_at": "2012-06-03T15:41:40Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/561#issuecomment-6086443", "updated_at": "2012-06-03T15:41:40Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 561, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/kenn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f3c42aa7989a9a0c37709abc08a6327f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F20d749bc05f47d2bd3026ce457dcfd8e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f3c42aa7989a9a0c37709abc08a6327f", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "kenn", "type": "User", "id": 10350, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kenn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52385e38bd3543c151012045"}, "id": 6086443, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/561"}
