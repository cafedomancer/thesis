I made a separate pull request for that version:\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4885#issuecomment-5490366\r\n\r\nIt received no love, and the consensus seems to be that it's OK to skip validations, skip attr_accessible, but it's not OK to skip callbacks.  I disagree with this philosophy, but whatever.  That pull request has been closed, so I shall close this one too.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52381ffebd3543c15100e875"}, "issue_id": 4884, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5518941", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4884#issuecomment-5518941", "updated_at": "2012-05-04T19:57:55Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99", "login": "patrick99e99", "gravatar_id": "648553f5c693d93c9ea2e042857ad22c", "html_url": "https://github.com/patrick99e99", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/648553f5c693d93c9ea2e042857ad22c?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F25b6a534a8c88b8e73fe7b865fd36bde.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 28946, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/patrick99e99/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-04T19:57:55Z", "id": 5518941, "owner": "rails"}
