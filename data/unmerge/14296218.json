I left some inline comments about the code, and besides that there's a few bits that might need some work:\r\n\r\n* The shadows are good, but the top red bar doesn't go along too much with then. Maybe reducing the `border-width` or trying a different shade of red could look better.\r\n* As @NARKOZ pointed, the 422 page looks broken/incomplete. Maybe just that one should have a `border-radius` on all corners.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e8bcbd3543c151009755"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9505#issuecomment-14296218"}
