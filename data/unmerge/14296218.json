I left some inline comments about the code, and besides that there's a few bits that might need some work:\r\n\r\n* The shadows are good, but the top red bar doesn't go along too much with then. Maybe reducing the `border-width` or trying a different shade of red could look better.\r\n* As @NARKOZ pointed, the 422 page looks broken/incomplete. Maybe just that one should have a `border-radius` on all corners.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e8bcbd3543c151009755"}, "issue_id": 9505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14296218", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9505#issuecomment-14296218", "updated_at": "2013-03-01T16:01:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza", "login": "lucasmazza", "gravatar_id": "5a90a67fa1a92e6a4b605cfd8da5e375", "html_url": "https://github.com/lucasmazza", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5a90a67fa1a92e6a4b605cfd8da5e375?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F742a53737ba9579f5fdab3038fe4b6b2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 80978, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lucasmazza/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-01T16:01:12Z", "id": 14296218, "owner": "rails"}
