{"body": "@josevalim I believe I've tracked the ``sort`` down to this issue: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2569, although I'm not sure if the sort is directly relevant because the fix was made in the hike gem. \r\n\r\nThe problem was that md5 fingerprints were different in development vs production because the dir file globs weren't sorted in the hike gem's ``entries`` method.\r\n\r\nThis makes me wonder if the ``sort`` in the ``expanded`` method actually is required since it seems like the fix was only required in the hike gem. @tenderlove do you remember if the ``sort`` in the ``expanded`` method was required to fix https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2569?
