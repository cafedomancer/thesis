If you are considering this pull request, all I am saying is that to get the real models path, we need to get the directory from `config.paths[\"app/models\"].first`, get `config.paths[\"app/controllers\"].first` for controllers and so on.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering the `require_dependency` pull request, we don't need to loop `config.paths`, as all load paths are already in the method I linked above.\r\n\r\n2) Yes, someone may want to get the absolute path for other reason, we can expose a method for that. But I prefer `require_dependency` exactly because it reminds developers to use `require_dependency` and not `require`. Using `require` may eventually lead to reloading headaches in development.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c95bd3543c15100e4f2"}, "issue_id": 5120, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4089065", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5120#issuecomment-4089065", "updated_at": "2012-02-21T21:17:58Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-02-21T21:17:58Z", "id": 4089065, "owner": "rails"}
