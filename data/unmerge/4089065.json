{"body": "1) It depends. If you are considering this pull request, all I am saying is that to get the real models path, we need to get the directory from `config.paths[\"app/models\"].first`, get `config.paths[\"app/controllers\"].first` for controllers and so on.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering the `require_dependency` pull request, we don't need to loop `config.paths`, as all load paths are already in the method I linked above.\r\n\r\n2) Yes, someone may want to get the absolute path for other reason, we can expose a method for that. But I prefer `require_dependency` exactly because it reminds developers to use `require_dependency` and not `require`.
