I.e. the following wouldn't work:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nmodule Foo\r\n  included do\r\n    class_attribute :foo\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nmodule ActiveRecord::Model\r\n  include Foo # we're not in a class, so class_attribute isn't defined\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason that it's in AM is because some AM modules use it.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to hear idea for other, nicer solutions :)", "_id": {"$oid": "5238188dbd3543c15100e07d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5412#issuecomment-5471788"}
