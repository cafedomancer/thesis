I.e. the following wouldn't work:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nmodule Foo\r\n  included do\r\n    class_attribute :foo\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nmodule ActiveRecord::Model\r\n  include Foo # we're not in a class, so class_attribute isn't defined\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason that it's in AM is because some AM modules use it.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to hear idea for other, nicer solutions :)", "_id": {"$oid": "5238188dbd3543c15100e07d"}, "issue_id": 5412, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5471788", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5412#issuecomment-5471788", "updated_at": "2012-05-02T20:44:24Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "login": "jonleighton", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-02T20:44:24Z", "id": 5471788, "owner": "rails"}
