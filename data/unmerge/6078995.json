{"body": "do not merge, I got a new idea!\nhttp://recxltd.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/seven-web-server-http-headers-that.html\nCurrently we already have 7 headers and this is only security - related headers\nI propose to add config.action_dispatch.default_headers hash, which will keep all default headers that rails will add to every response. configuration may look like this:\n```\n  config.action_dispatch.default_headers = {\n\"X-Frame-Options\" => \"SAMEORIGIN\",\n\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" => \"*\",\n\"X-Content-Type-Options\" => \"newsniff\"\n\"X-XSS-Protection\" => \"1; mode=block\",\n\"X-Content-Security-Policy\" => \"blahblahblahblah.......\"\n}\n```\n\nThis config is easy to understand and maintain, and agile if you just want to add your own default header. It may also contain content security policy string.\nI can do that, thoughts? /cc @josevalim @steveklabnik @spastorino @wycats @NZKoz ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6078995", "created_at": "2012-06-02T16:55:36Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6515#issuecomment-6078995", "updated_at": "2012-06-02T16:56:35Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6515, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/homakov", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc1464ded796adc7ac65355e3cc0df165.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/received_events", "gravatar_id": "d2881b5d4c082996a62f23055b61956d", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "homakov", "type": "User", "id": 174693, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/homakov/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e4fd8bd354364b900ef63"}, "id": 6078995, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6515"}
