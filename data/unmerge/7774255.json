{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7360", "repo": "rails", "body": "I frankly think that this divider option shouldn't even be added to Rails, so I think that if one needs further customization, it's a matter of giving the right collection to the helper instead of relying on the divider. \n\nAt the end, some people may want the first option to appear as a divider, others may not, and someone will end up wanting to add a new option like `divider_on_first: false` - I know that's a terrible name, but shows my point. So I'm :-1: on that.\n\nThanks for your contribution.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fcc5bd3543c15100ba22"}, "issue_id": 7360, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7774255", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7360#issuecomment-7774255", "updated_at": "2012-08-16T00:48:53Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-16T00:48:53Z", "id": 7774255, "owner": "rails"}
