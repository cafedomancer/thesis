{"body": "We sort of do follow semver, with a shifted version as Ruby does.\n\n> Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced.

It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated. It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.\n\nPatch versions of Rails do not introduce backwards-incompatible changes intentionally and do not usually add new features, except as necessary for security fixes or deprecations. That makes patch levels in Rails more like minor versions. Rails has no version number similar to patch versions. Ruby uses a similar scheme, but uses \"patch level\" versions for this purpose.\n\n> Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor version MUST be reset to 0 when major version is incremented.\n\nRails minor versions (3.0 => 3.1, 3.1 => 3.2, etc.) serve as major versions for Semver purposes. In general, we try to avoid introducing breaking changes in minor versions, but don't promise no breaking changes. In general, breaking changes in minor versions are paired with deprecation notices in a teeny version of the prior minor version.\n\nRails major versions usually make substantial breaking changes. The primary difference between minor and major releases in Rails is the magnitude of the breaking changes. Changes made in minor versions are small and should not require large-scale application changes, unless required for security fixes. Changes made in major releases often do require large-scale application changes (think XSS protection in Rails 3.0 and the Ruby 1.9 requirement in Rails 4.0).\n\nIn general, the first minor release of a new major release maintains as much backwards compatibility as possible with the last release, with the removal of that support in the `.1` (or later) release. For example, Rails 3.0 included support for the Rails 2.3 Router, ActionMailer syntax, ActiveRecord query API. Rails 3.1 and 3.2 removed much of this support.\n\nFrom that perspective, this change should be fine. That said, I'm unsure what this adds:\n\n* Before, updating to a new version required making a change to the Gemfile and running `bundle install`. This preserves conservative updating semantics and involves an intentional choice to use a particular Rails version.\n* After, updating to a new version means using `bundle update rails`. This does not preserve conservative updating semantics (it can result in an unnecessary update to a Rails dependency like Rack, even the dependency is shared with another gem that is not being updated).\n\nAs far as I can tell, the tradeoff is \"having to know what version of Rails is the latest version\" vs. \"overeager updating semantics\". Why do people think that breaking conservative updating semantics are worth it?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6128253", "created_at": "2012-06-05T15:42:09Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6610#issuecomment-6128253", "updated_at": "2012-06-05T15:42:09Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6610, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/wycats", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/428167a3ec72235ba971162924492609?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa87ff679a2f3e71d9181a67b7542122c.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/received_events", "gravatar_id": "428167a3ec72235ba971162924492609", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "wycats", "type": "User", "id": 4, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wycats/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380636bd3543c15100c8aa"}, "id": 6128253, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6610"}
