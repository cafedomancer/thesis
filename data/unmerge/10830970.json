For me, the part where `current_page?(action: 'checkout')` works and `current_page?(controller: 'shop')` doesn't, really seems like a bug, and I wanted to fix that.\r\nIf u guys think its ok, I'll just leave it, but If you guys think it's a little bit weird too, I'll looks inside the `url_for` method deeper.\r\nSince the `url_for` method returns a perfect url when I'm only passing the action, I think it's able to make it return a perfect url when I'm only passing the controller as well.\r\nI really think it should \"even work with only action, controller params\" or \"needs to be passed both action and controller param\".", "_id": {"$oid": "523d9711bd354364b900828c"}, "issue_id": 8334, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10830970", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8334#issuecomment-10830970", "updated_at": "2012-11-29T01:12:06Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/take/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/take/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/take/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/take/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/take", "login": "take", "gravatar_id": "653400f191791e1bcb454c05bfc14ed0", "html_url": "https://github.com/take", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/take/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/take/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/take/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/653400f191791e1bcb454c05bfc14ed0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F499656c8ba4b84f60ac1bf9fb1531f8f.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/take/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1095842, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/take/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-29T01:12:06Z", "id": 10830970, "owner": "rails"}
