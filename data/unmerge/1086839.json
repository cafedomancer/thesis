If there's a way to get a later version, would really appreciate your guidance.\n\nAlso, couldnt find any tests on any block/method in access.rb. So I'm guessing i'm working on the wrong access.rb file.\n\nI appreciate the help\n\nThanks again\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52386170bd3543c151012333"}, "issue_id": 362, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1086839", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/362#issuecomment-1086839", "updated_at": "2011-05-02T06:40:45Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abhijits54/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abhijits54/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abhijits54/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abhijits54/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/abhijits54", "login": "abhijits54", "gravatar_id": "bef2f0983ea4f63fee6805ec5d956882", "html_url": "https://github.com/abhijits54", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abhijits54/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abhijits54/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abhijits54/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/bef2f0983ea4f63fee6805ec5d956882?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fcab7c61722868edafe50f4755777f77a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abhijits54/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 677817, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abhijits54/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-02T06:40:24Z", "id": 1086839, "owner": "rails"}
