{"body": "Sorry, that should've been future tense as the [integrate-strong_parameters][1] branch hasn't been merged yet. In Rails 4 mass assignment will be moved out to a gem called `protected_attributes` and the gem `strong_parameters` will be incorporated as the preferred method of sanitizing form parameters, moving the implementation from the model to the controller where it's better suited.\n\nThe tests you've refactored have been removed in that branch so I'm closing the pull request as there's not much point in merging if they'll be removed once #7251 has been merged in.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commits/integrate-strong_parameters", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8052349", "created_at": "2012-08-27T10:42:35Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7454#issuecomment-8052349", "updated_at": "2012-08-27T10:42:35Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7454, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "pixeltrix", "type": "User", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fb79bd3543c15100b7f1"}, "id": 8052349, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7454"}
