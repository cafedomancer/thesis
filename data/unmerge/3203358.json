There are no\r\n> partial updates in PUT. There was a half-assed attempt to add those\r\n> semantics by committee in the midst of standardizing HTTP, but that\r\n> attempt failed because PUT's existing semantics had already been deployed\r\n> and we can't graft partial updates on top of existing replace semantics.\r\n> Period. End of story. Hence, PATCH was defined in 1995 (and finally\r\n> standardized much later because the WebDAV group was lazy).\r\n> \r\n> This answer is final. If anyone implements it differently in Rails,\r\n> then Rails will be neither compliant with HTTP nor compliant with REST.\r\n> Whether that matters to anyone developing Rails is besides the point.\r\n\r\nGame over, man.
