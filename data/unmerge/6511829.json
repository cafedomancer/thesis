Regardless, I hit this problem not when creating an index but much later when changing the table and the index got auto-renamed to temp_[previous name here]. So we need index names to be shorter than any auto-renaming done under the hood.", "_id": {"$oid": "523fe6c0bd354364b901c1ce"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1993#issuecomment-6511829"}
