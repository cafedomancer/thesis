{"body": "RE truncation\nseems we're having 2 conversations: 1) is it really a problem? 2) is the fix what we should be doing?\nI am trying to assert that it is really a problem, and that we shouldn't leave what's there.

Regardless, I hit this problem not when creating an index but much later when changing the table and the index got auto-renamed to temp_[previous name here]. So we need index names to be shorter than any auto-renaming done under the hood.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6511829", "created_at": "2012-06-22T16:18:44Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1993#issuecomment-6511829", "updated_at": "2012-06-22T16:18:44Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 1993, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/softwaregravy", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a88bec2f50dd9f21cd282432cb9e7a92?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4c9b5a6919028b0fbe0601f9428681d5.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/received_events", "gravatar_id": "a88bec2f50dd9f21cd282432cb9e7a92", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "softwaregravy", "type": "User", "id": 426690, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523fe6c0bd354364b901c1ce"}, "id": 6511829, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1993"}
