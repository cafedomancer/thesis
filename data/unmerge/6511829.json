I wasn't specifically trying to defend the solution of truncation.\n\n> I don't see Rails prefixing things with temp_.\n\nI'll have to go look. Maybe it's postgres / mysql itself that does this? Regardless, I hit this problem not when creating an index but much later when changing the table and the index got auto-renamed to temp_[previous name here]. So we need index names to be shorter than any auto-renaming done under the hood.", "_id": {"$oid": "523fe6c0bd354364b901c1ce"}, "issue_id": 1993, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6511829", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1993#issuecomment-6511829", "updated_at": "2012-06-22T16:18:44Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy", "login": "softwaregravy", "gravatar_id": "a88bec2f50dd9f21cd282432cb9e7a92", "html_url": "https://github.com/softwaregravy", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a88bec2f50dd9f21cd282432cb9e7a92?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4c9b5a6919028b0fbe0601f9428681d5.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 426690, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/softwaregravy/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-22T16:18:44Z", "id": 6511829, "owner": "rails"}
