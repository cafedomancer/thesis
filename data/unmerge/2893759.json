This should be done by project developers on their own (which hopefully will also add samples and setup task)\r\n\r\n> Added .svn/ because you don't want to add other version control\r\ndirectories to the repository.\r\n\r\nHow frequent will this happen? This seems to be a rare case that should be handled individually.\r\n\r\n> Added test/tmp/ for the same reason tmp/ is ignored.\r\n\r\nAgain, it doesn't feel like this is very frequent.\r\n\r\n> Added coverage/, .yardoc/, and rdoc/ because they generate a lot of\r\nmessy HTML files that are supposed to be generated on the fly\r\n\r\nI may be fine with adding coverage and rdoc. Rails doesn't not ship with .yardoc, so people adding yard to their projects should add it.", "_id": {"$oid": "523831c8bd3543c15100f7e9"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3777#issuecomment-2893759"}
