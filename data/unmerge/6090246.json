This avoid acidental upgrade when the user run `bundle update` without pass the gem name.\n\nAs @drogus said, upgrade the rails is more than install the newest version. Gem author can use some private API that changed in the newest release or users can rely in bugged behavior, so I think that upgrade the rails version should be always conscious.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380636bd3543c15100c89c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6610#issuecomment-6090246"}
