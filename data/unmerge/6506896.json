{"body": "Also, I can't really understand why people find multi-threading programming for web applications so complicated. Unless you do a concious choice of sharing state among requests this should never happen. And if you chose to do it then it is likely that you also know the implications and will put mutexes around the shared object which is also pretty simple. Web applications usually are much simpler than most other threaded applications that can require more effort for doing proper threaded programming. And even in those cases, it is just another discipline to learn. Threaded-programming is not that hard. People over-estime it. It is just that some people in the Ruby community are not used to multi-thread programming yet. But they are smart and should learn about it very quickly if they don't already know how to write multi-threaded safe code.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6506896", "created_at": "2012-06-22T12:52:36Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6506896", "updated_at": "2012-06-22T12:52:36Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6685, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/rosenfeld", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2abdb50caf0dc5b510330f68b02db8e4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c3aa93f86af77d8b1071d5fd2b4c91a.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2abdb50caf0dc5b510330f68b02db8e4", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "rosenfeld", "type": "User", "id": 32246, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rosenfeld/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c738"}, "id": 6506896, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6685"}
