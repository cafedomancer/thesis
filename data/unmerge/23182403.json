{"body": "@frodsan I've come around to @al2o3cr and @steveklabnik 's way of thinking on this one, at least as long as the file gets loaded when the constant is referenced, because it could set off a long chain of loads, depending on how many classes (constants) were referenced in each subsequent load, i.e. if model A had an association referring to B as constant which loaded B which had associations referring to C, D, E and those were loaded which referred to... you see where I'm going. Maybe in some cases, you wouldn't mind this, but it might be bad for those that wouldn't make the mental connection that just referring to a constant in the class body would mean it would be loaded and set off the load chain. At the very least, if this were added, you might want to discuss why you would ever want to use a constant that is evaluated in the class body and why you wouldn't, probably both in the guide and rdoc for association methods, and that would seem to make things overly complex for those who are new to it.\r\n\r\nHowever, if const_missing were to load a proxy that didn't actually load the referenced class until it was acted upon (or something similar), then I think it would be less of a mess to refer to classes (constants) in the association class methods. Is that the way it works now?
