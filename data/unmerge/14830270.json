There used to be a lot of these problems but most of them went away when @jonleighton refactored the association code.\r\n\r\nThe `belongs_to :foo, :touch => true` code is also using the callbacks api so that may be definition order dependent as well.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f115bd3543c15100a3ac"}, "issue_id": 8674, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14830270", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8674#issuecomment-14830270", "updated_at": "2013-03-13T08:50:11Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-13T08:50:11Z", "id": 14830270, "owner": "rails"}
