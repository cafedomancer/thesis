{"body": "First thing: The original didn't have tests. I did run all rails test, but you are right, so tests will be added.\r\n\r\nSecond thing: Database lock - Users of Activerecord session-store are probably are using Mysql - INNODB, which uses row-level locking. For example: our app has a dashboard page, which uses ajax for the content of a couple of widgets. With the current rails session store implementation each ajax request is causing an UPDATE on the sessions table. Because Innodb is locking the sessiondata-row when writing on update, all ajax requests are executed in sequence instead of parallel. This will be true for any database that does lock-on-write.\r\n\r\nIt's correct that this is changing the behavior of updated_at from last accessed to last changed, but the current behavior of db-sessionstore is making it unusable for parallel ajax-heavy applications.\r\n\r\nThird thing: Are you sure? Because I can't think of a situation when just comparing marshalled data will cause a problem. Comparing the unmarshalled data if the marshalled data is different would be an additional optimization which will probably create more overhead that just updating the session.\r\n\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1432429", "created_at": "2011-06-24T13:55:45Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1846#issuecomment-1432429", "updated_at": "2011-06-24T14:02:28Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 1846, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/barttenbrinke", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/a49172d1ddae42fa062770b59823c01d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F313e98866f7643ecdbf07e2ba4cfc55b.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/received_events", "gravatar_id": "a49172d1ddae42fa062770b59823c01d", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "barttenbrinke", "type": "User", "id": 8935, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/barttenbrinke/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52384d5fbd3543c1510114d5"}, "id": 1432429, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1846"}
