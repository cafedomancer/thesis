{"body": "@route right. I was referencing @josevalim's comment, \"you can still pass ?debug=1\", which I understood as a sort of hybrid of the two features you mentioned. You could optionally debug the `javascript_include_tag` (as you in `debug: true`) but do it per request (as in your `?body=1`). That would seem to be useful for app in which the `config.assets.debug = true` makes the response very slow.\r\n\r\nI don't see such a feature there now, so I suppose I am misinterpreting the comment.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/15693925", "created_at": "2013-03-31T16:43:43Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3180#issuecomment-15693925", "updated_at": "2013-03-31T16:43:43Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3180, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turadg/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turadg/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turadg/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/turadg", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turadg/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/turadg", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turadg/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/505c3b14e04b128d233f1c92251c17ee?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa76c856f36b4d6f8b0a9bca9d3e81654.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turadg/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turadg/received_events", "gravatar_id": "505c3b14e04b128d233f1c92251c17ee", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turadg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "turadg", "type": "User", "id": 21505, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/turadg/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523839bebd3543c15101011f"}, "id": 15693925, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3180"}
