There have been some valid reservations about this but ultimately it's just a name, and one that is already used by Underscore.js and Prototype.\r\n* At the moment, we're not going to add support for plucking multiple attributes. It was felt that plucking a single attribute is going to be 99% of the use case. Those who need multiple attributes can of course create a plugin. And we can come back to this question in the future if necessary.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to review a patch to map the existing records if they are already loaded.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contributions.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f656"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3253765"}
