There have been some valid reservations about this but ultimately it's just a name, and one that is already used by Underscore.js and Prototype.\r\n* At the moment, we're not going to add support for plucking multiple attributes. It was felt that plucking a single attribute is going to be 99% of the use case. Those who need multiple attributes can of course create a plugin. And we can come back to this question in the future if necessary.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to review a patch to map the existing records if they are already loaded.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contributions.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f656"}, "issue_id": 3871, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3253765", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3253765", "updated_at": "2011-12-22T19:37:10Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "login": "jonleighton", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-22T19:37:10Z", "id": 3253765, "owner": "rails"}
