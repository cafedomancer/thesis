I resolved this ticket more as an indication that I wasn't going to be able/willing to fix it anymore. Between the time I first opened this ticket, and the time I doug into a potential fix there was some pretty serious refactoring and now (by my estimate) it's a lot more work to warn ahead of time. I'm still interested in a fix, and willing to help/do one, but only if there's a clean way to do it which I couldn't find.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f64bbd3543c15100adfc"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8058#issuecomment-12067470"}
