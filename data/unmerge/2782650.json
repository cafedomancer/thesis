When we discussed this it was not totally obvious whether it should be merged or not. Some people use html translations like so:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\ntranslate(\"link_html\", :link => link_to(...))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch would break that code.\r\n\r\nAfter a fair bit of discussion we decided that we should improve the documentation to make people aware that using `translate` in this way does not escape the interpolated input.\r\n\r\n(BTW, this patch also overlooked a different vector: https://gist.github.com/b690a996c21c769fec51)\r\n\r\nJon", "_id": {"$oid": "523833c6bd3543c15100fa74"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3664#issuecomment-2782650"}
