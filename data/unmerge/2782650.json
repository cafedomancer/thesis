{"body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nThanks for the patch. When we discussed this it was not totally obvious whether it should be merged or not. Some people use html translations like so:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\ntranslate(\"link_html\", :link => link_to(...))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch would break that code.\r\n\r\nAfter a fair bit of discussion we decided that we should improve the documentation to make people aware that using `translate` in this way does not escape the interpolated input.\r\n\r\n(BTW, this patch also overlooked a different vector: https://gist.github.com/b690a996c21c769fec51)\r\n\r\nJon", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2782650", "created_at": "2011-11-17T21:58:46Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3664#issuecomment-2782650", "updated_at": "2011-11-17T21:58:46Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3664, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jonleighton", "type": "User", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523833c6bd3543c15100fa74"}, "id": 2782650, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3664"}
