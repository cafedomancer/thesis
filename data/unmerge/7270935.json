Especially in unit tests.\n\nIt comes from associations cache that in fact doesn't expire themselves.\nAnd newcommers are especially vulnerable to this problem as they don't know about association cache. I saw how long their investigation could be in this case.\n \nIt's undoubted that IM overhead will be a problem, but if we have an cache inside of AR than we have to update it in a right way.  \n\n@sskirby thanks for your hard work.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e4e93bd354364b900ee8f"}, "issue_id": 6524, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7270935", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6524#issuecomment-7270935", "updated_at": "2012-07-26T07:17:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan", "login": "bogdan", "gravatar_id": "91913f6ab8085bab0f2aa43995ba8ca2", "html_url": "https://github.com/bogdan", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/91913f6ab8085bab0f2aa43995ba8ca2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F926d19e70f74c20f796d376aafa3c6e2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 122436, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-26T07:17:28Z", "id": 7270935, "owner": "rails"}
