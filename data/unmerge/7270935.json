Especially in unit tests.\n\nIt comes from associations cache that in fact doesn't expire themselves.\nAnd newcommers are especially vulnerable to this problem as they don't know about association cache. I saw how long their investigation could be in this case.\n \nIt's undoubted that IM overhead will be a problem, but if we have an cache inside of AR than we have to update it in a right way.  \n\n@sskirby thanks for your hard work.", "_id": {"$oid": "523e4e93bd354364b900ee8f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6524#issuecomment-7270935"}
