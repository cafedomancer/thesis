I am happy to merge the first commit, but I would like to try something else for the second. So can you send me a separate PR for the first commit and I'll get that merged?\r\n\r\nRegarding the second commit, rather than specify `table_name.column_name` in the arguments to `update_all`, I'd like to try having `update_all` solve this automatically. It would do this by applying an alias to the table name which is being updated, and then always using this alias to reference the columns. Something like this:\r\n\r\n``` sql\r\nUPDATE posts _update_table SET _update_table.name = 'foo';\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f2d2bd3543c15100a6ec"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8473#issuecomment-12416522"}
