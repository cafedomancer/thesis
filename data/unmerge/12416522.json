{"body": "Cool. I am happy to merge the first commit, but I would like to try something else for the second. So can you send me a separate PR for the first commit and I'll get that merged?\r\n\r\nRegarding the second commit, rather than specify `table_name.column_name` in the arguments to `update_all`, I'd like to try having `update_all` solve this automatically. It would do this by applying an alias to the table name which is being updated, and then always using this alias to reference the columns.
