Other words (agrufe, carafe, fife, rafe, rife, safe, sife, stife, strafe, strife, etc.) are all incorrect (you can see a fuller list with `egrep '([^lwn][aeiou])fe$' /usr/share/dict/words`)\n\nOut of the second list, aves, fives, graves, greaves, pelves, and vives are all wrong (hives was marked as an irregular). Words that don't appear on that list for some reason, but would also be wrong, are drives and reprieves (probably others that I can't think of immediately). It seems pretty clear to me that this default rule is more of an exception and should be handled as an exception on individual cases.", "_id": {"$oid": "523803dbbd3543c15100c4db"}, "issue_id": 6820, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6497381", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6820#issuecomment-6497381", "updated_at": "2012-06-22T01:40:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis", "login": "davidcelis", "gravatar_id": "9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidcelis", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3e1a626a9e0c39eb548886c253bf9644.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 36873, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-21T23:39:03Z", "id": 6497381, "owner": "rails"}
