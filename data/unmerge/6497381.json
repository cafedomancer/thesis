Words that don't appear on that list for some reason, but would also be wrong, are drives and reprieves (probably others that I can't think of immediately). It seems pretty clear to me that this default rule is more of an exception and should be handled as an exception on individual cases.", "_id": {"$oid": "523803dbbd3543c15100c4db"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6820#issuecomment-6497381"}
