However, really solving this problem would also mean rendering automatically 500 errors in json and xml. All errors defaultly need to behave the same way.\r\n\r\nAnd since there is no clear standard on how APIs should render errors, and every app does it it's own way, let them do so. A responder can easily allow you to manage that.", "_id": {"$oid": "523809efbd3543c15100ce7a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6394#issuecomment-21487996"}
