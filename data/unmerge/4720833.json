In the case of nonzero? it's \"Returns self if num is not zero, nil otherwise. This behavior is useful when chaining comparisons\". Other people showed you the documentation for other predicates.\r\n\r\nSaying something returns true makes the user of that method expect it to be the singleton true regardless of the font you use.\r\n\r\nWith this change you are breaking someone's code (and possibly other people's code) and having no benefit at all except \"This is Ruby style and I don't care what I said in the documentation\". Also: why was the method changed? What was the improvement?\r\n\r\nYou have two choices: 1. make the method return true or false or 2. document that the method returns zero when the predicate is truthy.
