{"body": "I'd love to see this reopened.  I've got a pull request in to the activerecord-sqlserver-adapter, but the fix is fairly ugly (similar to what arkadiyk did above).  A fix in rails would be much cleaner, and should not impact databases that support unnamed columns.  This manifested itself for me when trying to call exists? on a model that had an offset.  Dealing with offsets in SQL server is somewhat awkward, requiring a subquery inside the main query, and SQL Server really doesn't like having an unnamed column in the subquery.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4395128", "created_at": "2012-03-08T16:44:48Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2062#issuecomment-4395128", "updated_at": "2012-03-08T16:44:48Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 2062, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/metalbot/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/metalbot/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/metalbot/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/metalbot", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/metalbot/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/metalbot", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/metalbot/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/942f0170639d3fd6d2bd3a2ce057e3e7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F1efc957d4a30c17787ec6362fd12b4de.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/metalbot/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/metalbot/received_events", "gravatar_id": "942f0170639d3fd6d2bd3a2ce057e3e7", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/metalbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "metalbot", "type": "User", "id": 567580, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/metalbot/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523848dbbd3543c1510111bc"}, "id": 4395128, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2062"}
