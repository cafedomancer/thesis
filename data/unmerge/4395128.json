I've got a pull request in to the activerecord-sqlserver-adapter, but the fix is fairly ugly (similar to what arkadiyk did above).  A fix in rails would be much cleaner, and should not impact databases that support unnamed columns.  This manifested itself for me when trying to call exists? on a model that had an offset.  Dealing with offsets in SQL server is somewhat awkward, requiring a subquery inside the main query, and SQL Server really doesn't like having an unnamed column in the subquery.", "_id": {"$oid": "523848dbbd3543c1510111bc"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2062#issuecomment-4395128"}
