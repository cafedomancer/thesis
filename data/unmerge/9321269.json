I don't think an extra manifest will make much difference, compared to the rest of your changed assets.\r\n\r\nNot having to generate non-digest assets would definitely cut down the processing time by 50%, but this pull request also cuts down the processing time by 50%. It only takes about 64 milliseconds to strip digests and copy the files.\r\nAlso, the hacky rake env reset has been removed from recent versions of the asset pipeline, as well as this pull request.\r\n\r\nI do agree that it would great to generate all the static pages in `public/`. You might be interested in the Rake task I've written to precompile all my static pages, including error pages: https://gist.github.com/3868731\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean about sprockets needing to understand files in `public/`. If a template is compiled to `public/404.html`, it will just be served by nginx or Rack::Static.\r\n\r\n@guilleiguaran - Sounds good! Very happy to remove that code if it's not relevant anymore.", "_id": {"$oid": "523dc1f1bd354364b9009bfd"}, "issue_id": 7866, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9321269", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7866#issuecomment-9321269", "updated_at": "2012-10-10T22:04:30Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent", "login": "ndbroadbent", "gravatar_id": "4931eceec58528529fd004e56af197c4", "html_url": "https://github.com/ndbroadbent", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4931eceec58528529fd004e56af197c4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6c444601992735a1c059ce1fdf1d4587.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 139536, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-10T21:59:27Z", "id": 9321269, "owner": "rails"}
