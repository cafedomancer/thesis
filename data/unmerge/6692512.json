If you do, there is more info in the 6a1f50b commit message.\n\nThanks. So instead we could move the dup call to inside the global template before it calls formats? At first, I don't see to dup every time we call `lookup_context.formats=`.\n\n>  No locking is done by Cache#[]. Don't know about the array key, will bench that later.\n\nIf no locking is done that already helps. We still should benchmark what is the best way to store the keys though. :)\n\nThanks a lot!", "_id": {"$oid": "523801f5bd3543c15100c22c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6917#issuecomment-6692512"}
