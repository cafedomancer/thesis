If you have a mountable engine, the script_name will also be set but in this case, asset_path still should not consider script path because the entity responsible for delivering assets is in the main application (sprockets in this case).\r\n\r\nSo I think we should create a mountable engine and ensure we can still access its assets after this patch. Things can get even trickier, because you have can have a mountable engine with Passenger's script_name and in this case we should use only the one coming from passenger. Here are a couple places to look at:\r\n\r\n* `config.relative_url_root` - if this option still exist in action controller, it will give you only the passenger stuff therefore you can rely on it instead\r\n* If not, the code in this module is a good starting point: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/url_for.rb", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e7bbbd3543c151009605"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9646#issuecomment-14683760"}
