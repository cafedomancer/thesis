If you have a mountable engine, the script_name will also be set but in this case, asset_path still should not consider script path because the entity responsible for delivering assets is in the main application (sprockets in this case).\r\n\r\nSo I think we should create a mountable engine and ensure we can still access its assets after this patch. Things can get even trickier, because you have can have a mountable engine with Passenger's script_name and in this case we should use only the one coming from passenger. Here are a couple places to look at:\r\n\r\n* `config.relative_url_root` - if this option still exist in action controller, it will give you only the passenger stuff therefore you can rely on it instead\r\n* If not, the code in this module is a good starting point: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/url_for.rb", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e7bbbd3543c151009605"}, "issue_id": 9646, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14683760", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9646#issuecomment-14683760", "updated_at": "2013-03-10T16:12:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-03-10T16:12:28Z", "id": 14683760, "owner": "rails"}
