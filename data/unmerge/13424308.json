{"body": "@graysonwright there are basically two criteria for whether a new feature is added to Rails:\r\n\r\n1. Can it be used within the Rails codebase? This covers most of Active Support which is not a general Ruby extension library like [Ruby Facets][1], but specifically for Rails or developing web applications.\r\n\r\n2. Is it a generalized feature and be of use to a large proportion of Rails users? For example we have a generic `<video>` tag helper but not a helper for generating embedded YouTube videos even though it might be used by a large number of developers.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://rubyworks.github.com/facets/", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13424308", "created_at": "2013-02-12T09:29:53Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5490#issuecomment-13424308", "updated_at": "2013-02-12T09:29:53Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5490, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "pixeltrix", "type": "User", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523ebd11bd354364b901265f"}, "id": 13424308, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5490"}
