If you mean ls, then there are multiple options to that tool:\n\n    $ ls -l 1MB \n    -rw-r--r-- 1 trejkaz trejkaz 1000000 2011-04-26 12:33 1MB\n    $ ls -lh 1MB \n    -rw-r--r-- 1 trejkaz trejkaz 977K 2011-04-26 12:33 1MB\n    $ ls -l --si 1MB \n    -rw-r--r-- 1 trejkaz trejkaz 1.0M 2011-04-26 12:33 1MB\n\nAs for user understanding, if no applications were to show it the right way, users would never discover the right way.  It's obviously up to applications to educate people on this, or everyone would keep doing it wrong (at least if we used eduardordm's logic.  Proper units have been in place on both Mac OS and Ubuntu for some time, and I don't remember any major backlash about that.)\n\nThat aside, there are really three options here:\n\n1. Use KiB, MiB, GiB and base 1024 (`:prefix => :binary`)\n2. Use kB, MB, GB and base 1000 (`:prefix => :si`)\n3. Use KB, MB, GB and base 1024 (`:prefix => :microsoft`)  (best name I can come up with, since most people seem to want to use them as the straw man for their argument about why anyone should be using this extremely outdated way of doing things.)\n\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52386324bd3543c15101247f"}, "issue_id": 292, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1068114", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/292#issuecomment-1068114", "updated_at": "2011-04-28T04:34:43Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trejkaz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trejkaz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trejkaz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trejkaz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/trejkaz", "login": "trejkaz", "gravatar_id": "42b570f6f4312a872c2fc671e3ddc82b", "html_url": "https://github.com/trejkaz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trejkaz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trejkaz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trejkaz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/42b570f6f4312a872c2fc671e3ddc82b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ff20c6342d31611a5417e5aa8c3a1ba.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trejkaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 43236, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/trejkaz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-28T04:09:21Z", "id": 1068114, "owner": "rails"}
