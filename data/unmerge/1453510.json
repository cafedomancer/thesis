So the huge majority needs to list just one dependency (rails) and the other ones can break it down.\r\n\r\nWe could even change rails/all to ignore a file if it can't be loaded so you only need to change the Gemfile. In other words, this discussion would be better solved with a patch. ;)", "_id": {"$oid": "52384d2bbd3543c1510114ac"}, "issue_id": 1855, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1453510", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1855#issuecomment-1453510", "updated_at": "2011-06-28T09:51:53Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-28T09:51:53Z", "id": 1453510, "owner": "rails"}
