{"body": "I completely agree with @dmathieu. \r\n\r\nThe problem with ```--skip-public-assets``` is that this name implies that all assets will be removed, which I think is far from being a common case.\r\n\r\nI think the best approach is to delete index.html when using ```--skip-index-html```. The basic application generated by rails new only uses this image on index.html, which is being deleted when using ```--skip-index-html```. So, if someone wants to use this image, but wants to remove index.html , which is probably uncommon, he can download the image on the website or just copy it from a another application.
