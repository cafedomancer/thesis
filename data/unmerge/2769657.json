If you have `nil` on Ruby 1.8, it has an `id` method, so will get called successfully. It's debatable whether that's the best implementation, but we can't change it now.\r\n\r\nAlso, patches should be submitted to the master branch.\r\n\r\nThanks", "_id": {"$oid": "523834fdbd3543c15100fbb7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3557#issuecomment-2769657"}
