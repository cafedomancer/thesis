If you have `nil` on Ruby 1.8, it has an `id` method, so will get called successfully. It's debatable whether that's the best implementation, but we can't change it now.\r\n\r\nAlso, patches should be submitted to the master branch.\r\n\r\nThanks", "_id": {"$oid": "523834fdbd3543c15100fbb7"}, "issue_id": 3557, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2769657", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3557#issuecomment-2769657", "updated_at": "2011-11-16T23:09:30Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "login": "jonleighton", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-16T23:09:30Z", "id": 2769657, "owner": "rails"}
