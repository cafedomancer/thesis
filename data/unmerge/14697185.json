{"body": "Here's the situation. We need to redefine the default `scaffold_controller_generator`. One way to do that is something like this:\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyEngine < ::Rails::Engine\r\n  config.generators.scaffold_controller = :my_scaffold_controller\r\nend\r\n```\r\nSo, now when you invoke `scaffold`, which hooks for `scaffold_controller`, `my_scaffold_controller` gets invoked instead \u2014 just what we need. BUT, when you try to invoke `scaffold_controller` directly, the override doesn't work, and rails run original `scaffold_controller`\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, the other solution would be to augment the original `scaffold_controller` to do what we need. I've found the only way  to do that, which is something like that:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'rails/generators'\r\nrequire 'rails/generators/rails/scaffold_controller/scaffold_controller_generator'\r\n\r\nmodule Rails\r\n  module Generators\r\n    class ScaffoldControllerGenerator\r\n     \r\n      # redefining methods and adding hooks\r\n    \r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that approach breaks a lot of things. First, it requires generators all the time, even when we don't need them .Second, it preemptively triggers generators configuration to be build, so other gems trying to change generators config later fail, because the configuration does not pick changes from engines after being loaded.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14697185", "created_at": "2013-03-11T04:23:20Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9647#issuecomment-14697185", "updated_at": "2013-03-11T04:23:20Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9647, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rwz/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rwz/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rwz/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rwz", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rwz/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/rwz", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rwz/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/df08a0889bad0229c372f702976a3da6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8716d223c5dd124d03b36a73660ca54e.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rwz/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rwz/received_events", "gravatar_id": "df08a0889bad0229c372f702976a3da6", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rwz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "rwz", "type": "User", "id": 129043, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rwz/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e7b8bd3543c1510095f7"}, "id": 14697185, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9647"}
