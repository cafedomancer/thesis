{"body": "The current performance of xhr? is fine, this patch will not bring a performance improvement to any application. Thanks for the pull request anyway.\r\n\r\nNote: We don't do such micro performance optimizations in Rails, for instance, we write `map(&:to_s)`, we don't bother having to write `map { |x| x.to_s }` even though the former is \"slower\", because it simply doesn't affect any app at the end of the day.
