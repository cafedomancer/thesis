Thanks for the pull request anyway.\r\n\r\nNote: We don't do such micro performance optimizations in Rails, for instance, we write `map(&:to_s)`, we don't bother having to write `map { |x| x.to_s }` even though the former is \"slower\", because it simply doesn't affect any app at the end of the day. Please send pull requests optimizing ARel, the rendering stack, etc. and I will gladly discuss and merge it.", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd39"}, "issue_id": 5580, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4689260", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4689260", "updated_at": "2012-03-26T09:59:19Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-26T07:48:16Z", "id": 4689260, "owner": "rails"}
