Thanks for the pull request anyway.\r\n\r\nNote: We don't do such micro performance optimizations in Rails, for instance, we write `map(&:to_s)`, we don't bother having to write `map { |x| x.to_s }` even though the former is \"slower\", because it simply doesn't affect any app at the end of the day. Please send pull requests optimizing ARel, the rendering stack, etc. and I will gladly discuss and merge it.", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd39"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4689260"}
