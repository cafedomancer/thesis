It should be made clear that that\u2019s _not_ something you should assume in Ruby. @fxn has imo more than enough explained why in general this _should_ not be expected behavior.\r\n\r\nChoosing between a truthy value vs `true` is a style-issue in Ruby. This is good, because it allows you to return values other than `true` or `false` when you need/want that, but still have a nice `?` at the end of the method. Changing this concept would mean we as lib authors lose freedom, as users will start to expect it more and more.\r\n\r\nSo imo, even-though I understand the OP\u2019s point on this specific case, in general you can\u2019t expect people to change their style choice when you want to use _their_ code (Rails).", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e230"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4670211", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4670211", "updated_at": "2012-03-24T00:06:17Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alloy/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alloy/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alloy/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alloy/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alloy", "login": "alloy", "gravatar_id": "424a9ce662b059c35063b405e160461d", "html_url": "https://github.com/alloy", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alloy/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alloy/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alloy/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/424a9ce662b059c35063b405e160461d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fa70dc40477bc2adceef4d2c90f47eb82.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alloy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2320, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alloy/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-24T00:05:05Z", "id": 4670211, "owner": "rails"}
