{"body": "Lets to my points about this patch:\r\n\r\n1. Not every applications would be beneficed by this feature.\r\n1. Reading the code it is clearly a copy of the errors feature (what could mean you can use it instead of adding a new structure to Rails)\r\n1. You can archive the same thing using the reflection API to get what validations the field has and building the hints without need to create a new structure to it on the framework\r\n1. There are gems doing this without use the validations API that, IMO, is not the right way to do it https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form/blob/master/lib/simple_form/components/hints.rb https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11666005", "created_at": "2012-12-24T21:12:05Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8602#issuecomment-11666005", "updated_at": "2012-12-24T21:12:05Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8602, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/rafaelfranca", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2c7b84fa30f0cea96a90729afe2970a0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events", "gravatar_id": "0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "rafaelfranca", "type": "User", "id": 47848, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f1babd3543c15100a4ac"}, "id": 11666005, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8602"}
