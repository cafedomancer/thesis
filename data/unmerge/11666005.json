Not every applications would be beneficed by this feature.\r\n1. Reading the code it is clearly a copy of the errors feature (what could mean you can use it instead of adding a new structure to Rails)\r\n1. You can archive the same thing using the reflection API to get what validations the field has and building the hints without need to create a new structure to it on the framework\r\n1. There are gems doing this without use the validations API that, IMO, is not the right way to do it https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form/blob/master/lib/simple_form/components/hints.rb https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f1babd3543c15100a4ac"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8602#issuecomment-11666005"}
