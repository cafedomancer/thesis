As true values, the hash stores the original attribute name from which the generated method gets its name. There is here no idea of data type.\r\n\r\nAs @al2o3cr said this code was used in the previous implementation of the dynamic finders. Note that not all dynamic finders are deprecated, the singulars like `find_by_email` are fully supported, those are not going anywhere. But the current implementation of what remains in Rails 4 from dynamic finders no longer uses that method.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is that this method is obsolete, internal, and nodoc'ed, so I am just going to remove it in master.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d529bd3543c15100819a"}, "issue_id": 11406, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/21005022", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11406#issuecomment-21005022", "updated_at": "2013-07-15T21:25:55Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-15T21:25:33Z", "id": 21005022, "owner": "rails"}
