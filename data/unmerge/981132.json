{"body": "I offered you a clear explanation of why the semantic difference mattered and my personal appreciation for that difference. You choose to take to first belittle that argument with \"silly\" and then consider it a slight. Now you're crying uncle because I didn't pick up on your off-ticket request for forgiveness on silly? Please.\r\n\r\nBack on topic: Let this be an open invitation for more expressiveness around these methods. I'm looking for the opposite version of Object#in? (no, #out? doesn't fit, and #not_in? is ugly). Just like we have blank/present and include/exclude. I already have a good fit for #either? in #neither? but I'm hesitant to add it unless we can find a version for #in?.\r\n\r\nHow's that for expressiveness. We'll then have 5 semantic variations on Enumerable#include? :)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/981132", "created_at": "2011-04-10T21:18:54Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/258#issuecomment-981132", "updated_at": "2011-04-10T21:18:54Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 258, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhh", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ed9635566b34ade32274f510f0f9a6d2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fcdcb2f5c7b071143529ef7f2705dfbc4.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/received_events", "gravatar_id": "ed9635566b34ade32274f510f0f9a6d2", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "dhh", "type": "User", "id": 2741, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dhh/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386422bd3543c151012586"}, "id": 981132, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/258"}
