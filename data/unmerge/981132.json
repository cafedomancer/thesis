Please.\r\n\r\nBack on topic: Let this be an open invitation for more expressiveness around these methods. I'm looking for the opposite version of Object#in? (no, #out? doesn't fit, and #not_in? is ugly). Just like we have blank/present and include/exclude. I already have a good fit for #either? in #neither? but I'm hesitant to add it unless we can find a version for #in?.\r\n\r\nHow's that for expressiveness. We'll then have 5 semantic variations on Enumerable#include? :)", "_id": {"$oid": "52386422bd3543c151012586"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/258#issuecomment-981132"}
