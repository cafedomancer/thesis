{"body": "I'm not sure we should change code in such a way to allow other libs to do stuff, I know it's good to have points of integration, but nothing stops someone else to come and refactor this code, changing it again in a way that would make the external code break, without us even realizing that. At least a `nodoc` in this module, with some comments why it exists, would be good.\n\nI can't say if it's going to be merged or not.
