{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7393", "repo": "rails", "body": "I'm not sure we should change code in such a way to allow other libs to do stuff, I know it's good to have points of integration, but nothing stops someone else to come and refactor this code, changing it again in a way that would make the external code break, without us even realizing that. At least a `nodoc` in this module, with some comments why it exists, would be good.\n\nI can't say if it's going to be merged or not. Thanks for your contribution.\n\n/cc @tenderlove ", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fc1bbd3543c15100b8db"}, "issue_id": 7393, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7857579", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7393#issuecomment-7857579", "updated_at": "2012-08-19T22:31:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-19T22:31:15Z", "id": 7857579, "owner": "rails"}
