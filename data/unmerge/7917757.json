Could we have a different name for that one? Or could we merge both modules? Makes sense? Where is `DocrailsKindle` used?\n\n* Some commented out code remains, could you please clean that?", "_id": {"$oid": "523824bdbd3543c15100ec66"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4526#issuecomment-7917757"}
