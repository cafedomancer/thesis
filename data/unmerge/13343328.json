The first is why do we need it in the first place? Besides, Rails already ships with a AS::FileUpdateChecker that notifies when change happens, why not extend it instead? Finally, I don't see a need to add a new type of queue, adding complexity to the notifications system.\r\n\r\nThat said, we need to understand what is the use case for this, the reason behind your design decisions and Rails it will make building Rails applications easier/faster, otherwise this may be better off as a Rails plugin.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ebdabd3543c151009bc7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9237#issuecomment-13343328"}
