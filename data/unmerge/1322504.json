{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1422", "repo": "rails", "body": "1) Yes - require 'xx/location/geoip_geocoders' will expect to define Xx::Location::GeoipGeocoder:\r\n\r\n    >> \"xx\".classify\r\n    => \"Xx\"\r\n\r\n2) If your hierarchy matches the class/module nesting then AS::Dependencies will walk the hierarchy so you're just adding more locations to search.\r\n\r\n3) autoload :Class, 'path/to/file' is for non-reloadable code that you want to defer loading until referenced - don't use it for model code.\r\n\r\n4) You can always use unloadable to mark a class/module as reloadable - but you wouldn't do that with a released gem. If the gem is an engine then use a relative path spec in your Gemfile and it will reload in development. require_dependency would work for the first file but any requires in the gem code would revert to non-reloadable\r\n\r\nAnyway we're straying off the point - this is the Rails issue tracker not Rails-Talk. If there's a specific, reproducible example where you think it isn't reloading properly or not finding a constant properly then please open a new issue with ideally a failing test or at least a link to a Github repo that exhibits the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523857a2bd3543c151011b8d"}, "issue_id": 1422, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1322504", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1422#issuecomment-1322504", "updated_at": "2011-06-07T21:01:39Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-07T21:01:39Z", "id": 1322504, "owner": "rails"}
