I've updated the pull request with all the changes you mentioned:\r\n\r\n* Source digests are now saved to a separate file: `sources_manifest.yml`\r\n* Renamed `config.assets.digest_files` back to `config.assets.digests` (P.S. This wouldn't break any plain Rails 3.2 apps, since all the helper methods were also updated internally. But other gems like `asset_sync` might have had some issues)\r\n* `private` method back to public\r\n\r\nRE: non-digest assets - I think there's definitely a case to keep them around if they can be compiled in 60ms. The only reason for #5379 is that they make the compile take twice as long, so I don't think anyone will care about making them optional if they don't add any extra overhead.\r\n\r\nHowever, the non-digest speedup is really only a secondary benefit. The main issue is that we wouldn't have any way to know if the non-digest asset was out of date, so we would need to recompile it every time. Unless we also had a `nondigest_manifest.yml` file to keep track of the non-digest digests... Otherwise, this would really limit the benefit of this pull request.\r\n\r\nI do agree that it would be much simpler if non-digest assets could go away entirely, but I think they still have some purpose (images in emails, etc.)", "_id": {"$oid": "523dc1f1bd354364b9009bf8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7866#issuecomment-9213596"}
