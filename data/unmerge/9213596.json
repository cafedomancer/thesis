{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7866", "repo": "rails", "body": "Hi there, thanks so much for your review! I've updated the pull request with all the changes you mentioned:\r\n\r\n* Source digests are now saved to a separate file: `sources_manifest.yml`\r\n* Renamed `config.assets.digest_files` back to `config.assets.digests` (P.S. This wouldn't break any plain Rails 3.2 apps, since all the helper methods were also updated internally. But other gems like `asset_sync` might have had some issues)\r\n* `private` method back to public\r\n\r\nRE: non-digest assets - I think there's definitely a case to keep them around if they can be compiled in 60ms. The only reason for #5379 is that they make the compile take twice as long, so I don't think anyone will care about making them optional if they don't add any extra overhead.\r\n\r\nHowever, the non-digest speedup is really only a secondary benefit. The main issue is that we wouldn't have any way to know if the non-digest asset was out of date, so we would need to recompile it every time. Unless we also had a `nondigest_manifest.yml` file to keep track of the non-digest digests... Otherwise, this would really limit the benefit of this pull request.\r\n\r\nI do agree that it would be much simpler if non-digest assets could go away entirely, but I think they still have some purpose (images in emails, etc.)", "_id": {"$oid": "523dc1f1bd354364b9009bf8"}, "issue_id": 7866, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9213596", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7866#issuecomment-9213596", "updated_at": "2012-10-07T23:07:54Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent", "login": "ndbroadbent", "gravatar_id": "4931eceec58528529fd004e56af197c4", "html_url": "https://github.com/ndbroadbent", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4931eceec58528529fd004e56af197c4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6c444601992735a1c059ce1fdf1d4587.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 139536, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-07T23:07:54Z", "id": 9213596, "owner": "rails"}
