Moreover it's going very deep into implementation. This make it hard to pass own sanitizer instance and even own sanitizer class to `#sanitize_from_mass_assignment` method without significant changes to the current implementation.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can propose connected with callback is something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity::Sanitizer.on_error = lambda {|attrs|\r\n  raise StandardError\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd implementation like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      def process_removed_keys(attrs)\r\n        if callback = self.class.on_error\r\n          callback.call(attrs)\r\n        else\r\n          self.logger.debug \"WARNING: Can't mass-assign protected attributes: #{attrs.join(', ')}\" if self.logger\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is still a configuration option.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52385997bd3543c151011d1e"}, "issue_id": 1320, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1241103", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1320#issuecomment-1241103", "updated_at": "2011-05-26T09:06:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan", "login": "bogdan", "gravatar_id": "91913f6ab8085bab0f2aa43995ba8ca2", "html_url": "https://github.com/bogdan", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/91913f6ab8085bab0f2aa43995ba8ca2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F926d19e70f74c20f796d376aafa3c6e2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 122436, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-26T09:06:27Z", "id": 1241103, "owner": "rails"}
