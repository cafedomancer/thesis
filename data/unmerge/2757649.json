RFCs currently in Draft Standard status will either be promoted to Internet Standard or demoted to Proposed Standard.\r\n\r\nBTW, Rails supports modern cookies and content-disposition headers which are also Proposed Standards, so there's no basis to reject PATCH just because it's a Proposed Standard.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Rails should be the framework that helps PATCH attain the Internet Standard status since Rails clearly needs PATCH in order to support non-replacing updates.\r\n\r\nWhether that happens in 4.0 or 3.2, I defer to the Rails core team.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012103"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2757649", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-2757649", "updated_at": "2011-11-16T09:44:44Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee", "login": "dlee", "gravatar_id": "139de3f8c3d6ee008cdb3abd3da23908", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlee", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/139de3f8c3d6ee008cdb3abd3da23908?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F80177fe965b78111f4dfee80cfdc3689.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 7035, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-16T09:44:44Z", "id": 2757649, "owner": "rails"}
