In the normal case it has to be deserialized anyway, and in the 'expired' case you're still forced to do the HMAC checks, I don't see a huge issue here.\r\n\r\nAs for your second point, you can't actually serialize hashes in cookies at present because of [this code](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/cookies.rb#L284-L290)\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n      def []=(name, options)\r\n        if options.is_a?(Hash)\r\n          options.symbolize_keys!\r\n          value = options[:value]\r\n        else\r\n          value = options\r\n          options = { :value => value }\r\n        end\r\n\r\n        handle_options(options)\r\n\r\n        if @cookies[name.to_s] != value or options[:expires]\r\n          @cookies[name.to_s] = value\r\n          @set_cookies[name.to_s] = options\r\n          @delete_cookies.delete(name.to_s)\r\n        end\r\n\r\n        value\r\n      end\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it's something we should write in the release notes, but we're not breaking anyone's apps by doing this unless they're doing some EGREGIOUS hax to avoid that check", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d81cbd3543c15100844a"}, "issue_id": 11168, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20717030", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11168#issuecomment-20717030", "updated_at": "2013-07-10T01:44:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-10T01:44:12Z", "id": 20717030, "owner": "rails"}
