{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/1855", "repo": "rails", "body": "DHH, why do I always see you treat other people's opinions as grandstanding, but your own grandstanding as law? You're about as UN-fair in your actions as you are in demanding that others _be_ fair. You're not the only one that uses this, you may have written it, but its moved into the masses and to act like a little kid all the time that threatens to take his ball and go home or bully and name call is just public grandstanding of your own and you acting just like that child with the ball.\r\n\r\nAs to the issue at hand, Sprockets or Jammit, or XYZ should be a choice that is easily changeable like a tire. Cucumber and other gems within the testing realm have recognized this and made support for different languages as separate gems like cucumber-rails, rspec-rails, etc. JavaScript is no less a target for that than testing is. As the modularity of Rails increases, the ability to pick and choose will become more pronounced and people will not fight or argue as much about what should or should not be included and the difficulty of swapping segments out for something else they'd rather use without destroying the entire chain. Forcing others to do as you bid simply because you don't want to make the effort isn't a good enough reason.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52384d2bbd3543c151011496"}, "issue_id": 1855, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1446723", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1855#issuecomment-1446723", "updated_at": "2011-06-27T11:49:00Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ddd/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ddd/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ddd/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ddd/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ddd", "login": "ddd", "gravatar_id": "4f26b34a72729f9543ba84c398dba2c2", "html_url": "https://github.com/ddd", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ddd/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ddd/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ddd/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4f26b34a72729f9543ba84c398dba2c2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd8dd1b11790f670653291a41d8fb915e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ddd/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 400620, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ddd/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-06-27T11:42:07Z", "id": 1446723, "owner": "rails"}
