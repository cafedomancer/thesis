{"body": "@josevalim @pixeltrix I was playing around with the Journey API to accurately tell the user which parameters are missing I was able to get a working solution that I would like some feedback on. It will require some modification to Journey\r\n\r\nThe code in ActionDispatch would change to something along these lines:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef descriptive_routing_error\r\n  error        = \"No route matches #{options.inspect}\"\r\n  missing_keys = missing_keys_for_route\r\n  error << \", missing #{missing_keys.inspect} #{'key'.pluralize(missing_keys.count)}\" if missing_keys.present?\r\n  error\r\nend\r\n\r\ndef missing_keys_for_route\r\n  @set.formatter.find_missing_keys(named_route, options, recall, PARAMETERIZE)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would require a `#find_missing_keys` method and a few helper methods to Journey to expose this information in a public method something along the lines of https://gist.github.com/2588053 . The basic idea is simple, if the route needs certain keys to create a valid url, Journey knows which keys are missing, so we can just expose that info via an endpoint.\r\n\r\n@tenderlove @fxn, what do you think of exposing information like this via Journey, doesn't need to be exposed via formatter, just wanted to get a proof of concept working. \r\n\r\nIf we have all of this information we should give it to the user, pending a clean maintainable solution.
