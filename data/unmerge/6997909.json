When they do, we want the full validation to run. Users can also be invited by an admin. In this case the User is created with only an email address. When the admin submits the form, we want the email to be validated, but not everything else. When the user logs in for the first time, then we want full validation.\n\nCurrently we are hacking this functionality into User model via `#valid_email?`. I would much prefer to use `#valid? :only => :email` when the admin create/invites the user. I thought the idea would be useful to others. I hope this helps.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380030bd3543c15100bf6c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7065#issuecomment-6997909"}
