I formulated the idea not quite exact. \r\n\r\nLeap years are calculcated correct, but only if [from_time > to_time](https://github.com/avakhov/rails/blob/e7975248a348a4c5fe4e0e997da02327d4d6e0d1/actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/date_helper.rb#L98-102). Method <tt>distance_of_time_in_words</tt> should work if from_time > to_time and if to_time < from_time (it was true before ae7d0d816db3f9a94008d36ab9efbe7583700981 and it's declared in documentation for method). Without my fix the condition (fyear > tyear) is true in case of from_time > to_time and false for back order of args. In the second case leap years discount will be ignored.\r\n\r\nI want to return symmetry to this method back.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238355fbd3543c15100fc3d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3530#issuecomment-2644564"}
