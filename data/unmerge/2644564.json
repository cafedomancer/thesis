I formulated the idea not quite exact. \r\n\r\nLeap years are calculcated correct, but only if [from_time > to_time](https://github.com/avakhov/rails/blob/e7975248a348a4c5fe4e0e997da02327d4d6e0d1/actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/date_helper.rb#L98-102). Method <tt>distance_of_time_in_words</tt> should work if from_time > to_time and if to_time < from_time (it was true before ae7d0d816db3f9a94008d36ab9efbe7583700981 and it's declared in documentation for method). Without my fix the condition (fyear > tyear) is true in case of from_time > to_time and false for back order of args. In the second case leap years discount will be ignored.\r\n\r\nI want to return symmetry to this method back.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238355fbd3543c15100fc3d"}, "issue_id": 3530, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2644564", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3530#issuecomment-2644564", "updated_at": "2011-11-06T09:32:56Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/avakhov/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/avakhov/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/avakhov/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/avakhov/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/avakhov", "login": "avakhov", "gravatar_id": "54e74983d81fa2fbe4c28e8392532f18", "html_url": "https://github.com/avakhov", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/avakhov/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/avakhov/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/avakhov/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/54e74983d81fa2fbe4c28e8392532f18?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fedb3b863d9333073200581afe223ec23.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/avakhov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 92554, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/avakhov/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-06T09:32:56Z", "id": 2644564, "owner": "rails"}
