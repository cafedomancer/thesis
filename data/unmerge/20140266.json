I wasn't sure if master was open for 4.1 so I figured I'd throw this pull request out there.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like the work here would be unnecessary if default scopes will be applied on the initial relation before anything else. Feel free to close this if that's the case. If the work here is similar to what will be done for 4.1, I'm happy to adjust the code here to reflect that.
