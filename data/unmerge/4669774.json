It is a natural way to express the behavior of a predicate isn't it.\r\n\r\nThat is also documented http://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_documentation_guidelines.html#regular-font\r\n\r\nBut users may or may not know the guidelines. Ruby programmers **know** a predicate returns something to be interpreted in a boolean context. You cannot expect the singletons! The singletons are for the author of the predicate, not for the caller to expect them.\r\n\r\nPersonal preferences are one thing, a formal language is a different thing.
