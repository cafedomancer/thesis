I and many other developers use it to put project documentation, not automated documentation. In any case, I don't think this pull request is buying us something. We are adding ignores for files that are not necessarily generated in a Rails project (like coverage) and the current comments at the top pointing to github are enough. I would maybe just add a small comment about ignoring `config/database.yml`, but that is it.
