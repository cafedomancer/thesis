In other words, is is possible that these two could be equal?\r\n\r\n    cookies.signed[:referer_id] = { value: arbitrary_user_controlled_value } # contains session_id, user_id, etc.\r\n    session[:user_id] = 42\r\n\r\nIt seems pretty unlikely you would have a `cookies.signed[:referrer_id]` cookie that is completely user controlled (why would you be signing a value that is completely user controlled anyway?).  But, I was just curious if that was what you were implying?
