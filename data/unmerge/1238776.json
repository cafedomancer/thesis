{"body": "Serialize as a verb feels like it implies a two-way operation. The default bcrypt password encryption is clearly one-way, but when storing a password, one-way isn't necessarily a requirement.\r\n\r\n`has_secure` as a general phrase could be taken to mean one- or two-way. To take the `has_secure :drivers_license` example, one might think that they could get the original data back out -- it's just stored \"securely\" (whatever that means). So maybe \"authenticatable\" is a better general purpose description than \"secure,\" especially when you're describing data other than passwords.
