{"body": "+1 on the idea. I don't think it'll be as easy as flipping a switch, but I think it's worth it we really start thinking about this and moving in this direction as a community. There's no reason why Rails shouldn't promote a multithreaded mindset by now, it seems like the next logical step after dropping Ruby 1.8.
