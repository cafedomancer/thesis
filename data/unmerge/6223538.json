I don't think it'll be as easy as flipping a switch, but I think it's worth it we really start thinking about this and moving in this direction as a community. There's no reason why Rails shouldn't promote a multithreaded mindset by now, it seems like the next logical step after dropping Ruby 1.8. Also, yes it's true we use Passenger and Unicorn nowadays, and they're both great and I don't expect them to go away any time soon. But if I could use just one process in exchange for having to be more conscious about thread safety, that'd be great. (Seems crazy in Ruby-land but I think we've just gotten used to the status quo.)", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c6e7"}, "issue_id": 6685, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6223538", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6223538", "updated_at": "2012-06-09T21:14:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire", "login": "mcmire", "gravatar_id": "e9e852b18079792bc5f4ec52b8e37c53", "html_url": "https://github.com/mcmire", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e9e852b18079792bc5f4ec52b8e37c53?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0d46839f6371fb84f6b6c682f5fc2c77.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 7371, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-09T21:14:12Z", "id": 6223538, "owner": "rails"}
