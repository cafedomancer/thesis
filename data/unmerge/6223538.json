I don't think it'll be as easy as flipping a switch, but I think it's worth it we really start thinking about this and moving in this direction as a community. There's no reason why Rails shouldn't promote a multithreaded mindset by now, it seems like the next logical step after dropping Ruby 1.8. Also, yes it's true we use Passenger and Unicorn nowadays, and they're both great and I don't expect them to go away any time soon. But if I could use just one process in exchange for having to be more conscious about thread safety, that'd be great. (Seems crazy in Ruby-land but I think we've just gotten used to the status quo.)", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c6e7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6223538"}
