That's the cost I see on this switch, it is not transparent.\r\n\r\nThink of private projects, teams of 4 people in small companies... it is common that _config/database.yml_ is in version control. Depending on one's environment that may be surprising, but small teams that trust and have everything transparent among their members simply know all about the production environment.\r\n\r\nIf we apply this, then you are optimizing for the complex case. The case where you want 2 files, and one of them in _.gitignore_. If we change and you want the current behavior, you need to undo things, one of them not very obvious. \r\n\r\nSince both uses cases are valid, appropriateness depends on the project, I personally prefer to continue defaulting to the simple one.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand there's sensitive information in there, and we have also the secret token... I believe there's something into it and we could explore @jeremy's idea.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380c97bd3543c15100d18f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6210#issuecomment-5619468"}
