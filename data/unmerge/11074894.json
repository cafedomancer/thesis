{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8434", "repo": "rails", "body": "@JoeyButler thanks for the PR but I'm :-1: on this - @carlosantoniodasilva had pretty much the same commit the other day, though he included the module rather that calling the method on the module like you've done. I'm not a big fan of single method modules and there's a deeper reason why this method is duplicated that I'm trying to address with a bigger refactoring of `Mapper`. Essentially what I'm doing is refactoring the `@scope` instance variable into a class rather than a hash and `Mapping` becomes a subclass of `Scope`. The `defaults_from_constraints` method would then become a protected instance method and the duplication would be eliminated.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f33cbd3543c15100a7ba"}, "issue_id": 8434, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11074894", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8434#issuecomment-11074894", "updated_at": "2012-12-06T06:51:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix", "login": "pixeltrix", "gravatar_id": "b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869", "html_url": "https://github.com/pixeltrix", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b14001f2b40640dd6cb63f0e8f1f4869?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cb36e23529e4de4c41460940cc85e6e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 6321, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/pixeltrix/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-06T06:51:29Z", "id": 11074894, "owner": "rails"}
