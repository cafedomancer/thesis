{"body": "\"Not good\" was probably the wrong wordage to use for what I'm trying to get at. Perhaps \"incorrect\" would have been a better choice for some, and \"unnecessary\" for others. It's strange to see an argument against changes to inflections being to avoid a lot of special cases when Rails already has esoteric special cases defined, and also strange because this opposition to defining special cases makes me wonder why certain inflections defined are exceptions and not rules. It's stranger still to see the argument of avoiding an influx of pull requests. If you actually were to get more pull requests to inflections, just close the ones that are adding esoteric special changes and maintain your policy. I don't see that as a good reason to keep inflections frozen.\n\nIt may help to note that extracting the inflections (and not the inflector) would provide a better way to make the inflector multilingual by providing inflection gems for other languages, and let the user choose which to bundle (with english_inflections as a default).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7051231", "created_at": "2012-07-17T22:15:39Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7071#issuecomment-7051231", "updated_at": "2012-07-17T22:22:31Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7071, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidcelis", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3e1a626a9e0c39eb548886c253bf9644.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/received_events", "gravatar_id": "9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "davidcelis", "type": "User", "id": 36873, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380016bd3543c15100bf39"}, "id": 7051231, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7071"}
