Yeah this is pretty nice, but update_attribute doesn't activate callbacks or validations either does it? Because I've used that several times to bypass validations and what not; so either I'm crazy or this would do the same thing?\r\n\r\nAlso I'm reading a nice testing book now, is `Topic` a stub or is that really coming from the database? I would imagine with Rails those kind of things can make the tests much faster.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385be6bd3543c151011e94"}, "issue_id": 1190, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1234708", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1190#issuecomment-1234708", "updated_at": "2011-05-25T11:09:27Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheEmpty/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheEmpty/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheEmpty/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheEmpty/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheEmpty", "login": "TheEmpty", "gravatar_id": "5225f74b5d05b955511d1d8a8f9dcf74", "html_url": "https://github.com/TheEmpty", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheEmpty/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheEmpty/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheEmpty/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/5225f74b5d05b955511d1d8a8f9dcf74?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff06f4bba5fef3a83215c3f3db1de4235.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheEmpty/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 371940, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TheEmpty/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-25T11:09:27Z", "id": 1234708, "owner": "rails"}
