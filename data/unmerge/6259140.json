{"body": "> I think we will all agree that multi-process is dominant today. I don't think it is a good idea to flip this for all users in Rails 4 because albeit it is fantastic to push this stuff to find bugs, in practice that means bugs in production for end-users that are running multi-process anyway.\n\nThis change is in the generators and only impacts newly created apps.\n\n> Lastly, about the existence of the flag, it would be awesome to be able to claim that Rails is thread-safe and remove it. Well, you need to forget about constant autoloading and some stuff that's nice in development mode and not thread-safe, so in the mid term Rails is not going to be thread-safe in all environments. Therefore, we cannot remove the flag.\n\nThis change is only to the production configuration, not the dev configuration.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6259140", "created_at": "2012-06-11T23:29:19Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6259140", "updated_at": "2012-06-11T23:29:19Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6685, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tenderlove", "type": "User", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c6ff"}, "id": 6259140, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6685"}
