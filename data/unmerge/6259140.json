I don't think it is a good idea to flip this for all users in Rails 4 because albeit it is fantastic to push this stuff to find bugs, in practice that means bugs in production for end-users that are running multi-process anyway.\n\nThis change is in the generators and only impacts newly created apps.\n\n> Lastly, about the existence of the flag, it would be awesome to be able to claim that Rails is thread-safe and remove it. Well, you need to forget about constant autoloading and some stuff that's nice in development mode and not thread-safe, so in the mid term Rails is not going to be thread-safe in all environments. Therefore, we cannot remove the flag.\n\nThis change is only to the production configuration, not the dev configuration.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c6ff"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6259140"}
