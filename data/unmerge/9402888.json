I think the html_safe on the url illustrates the intent better than skipping the escaping. Also there might be future changes, which should be escaped.\r\n\r\n@rafaelfranca let me know if you like passing `false` to `content_tag` better and I'll update the PR.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f796bd3543c15100b0a6"}, "issue_id": 7932, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9402888", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7932#issuecomment-9402888", "updated_at": "2012-10-13T10:36:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny", "login": "senny", "gravatar_id": "3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235", "html_url": "https://github.com/senny", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/3d698e2872c07061a455d9e250861235?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd1359f9934ee5a75ed441ffce412a0a1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5402, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/senny/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-13T10:36:42Z", "id": 9402888, "owner": "rails"}
