Having these two related functions behave differently on missing parameters is a big no no for me.  And altering the find_by_foo_and_bar to raise an error on a missing parameter will likely  break existing applications.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385a7dbd3543c151011dae"}, "issue_id": 1276, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1546744", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1276#issuecomment-1546744", "updated_at": "2011-07-11T14:17:05Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf", "login": "jeremyf", "gravatar_id": "a9b7461edb06ce10e12f865220e43948", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremyf", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/a9b7461edb06ce10e12f865220e43948?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Ff15d337c70078947cfe1b5d6f0ed3f13.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2130, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremyf/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-07-11T14:17:05Z", "id": 1546744, "owner": "rails"}
