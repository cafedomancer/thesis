I agree that it does bring about the minimum amount of education that if you don't want to learn about thread safety in Ruby, you will need to find this setting and disable it.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c700"}, "issue_id": 6685, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6259221", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6259221", "updated_at": "2012-06-11T23:42:43Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri", "login": "tarcieri", "gravatar_id": "4131d2f57a0db2a2b4d9a62bd389fd44", "html_url": "https://github.com/tarcieri", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4131d2f57a0db2a2b4d9a62bd389fd44?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fbeb22fb694d513edcf5533cf006dfeae.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 797, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-11T23:34:25Z", "id": 6259221, "owner": "rails"}
