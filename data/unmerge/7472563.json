So, instead of having to fix the whole line, or type `.tap { |o| puts o.inspect }`, I can just call `.peek`, run the test, and i'll see the \"#inspect\" result.\n\nSo, these are more use cases:\n\n```ruby\nUser.active.where(:created_at => 10.days.ago)\n```\n\nIf I want to print out active users for debugging purpose, instead of having to:\n\n```ruby\nUser.active.tap{ |u| puts u.inspect }.where(:created_at => 10.days.ago)\n```\n\nI'd just\n\n```ruby\nUser.active.peek.where(:created_at => 10.days.ago)\n```\n\n---\n\nAlso, adding `#peek` at the end of the line when it'll get assigned to the variable is easy:\n\n```ruby\n@users = User.active.where(:created_at => 10.days.ago).peek\n# instead of\n@users = User.active.where(:created_at => 10.days.ago)\nputs @users.inspect\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fdebbd3543c15100bc26"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7243#issuecomment-7472563"}
