So, instead of having to fix the whole line, or type `.tap { |o| puts o.inspect }`, I can just call `.peek`, run the test, and i'll see the \"#inspect\" result.\n\nSo, these are more use cases:\n\n```ruby\nUser.active.where(:created_at => 10.days.ago)\n```\n\nIf I want to print out active users for debugging purpose, instead of having to:\n\n```ruby\nUser.active.tap{ |u| puts u.inspect }.where(:created_at => 10.days.ago)\n```\n\nI'd just\n\n```ruby\nUser.active.peek.where(:created_at => 10.days.ago)\n```\n\n---\n\nAlso, adding `#peek` at the end of the line when it'll get assigned to the variable is easy:\n\n```ruby\n@users = User.active.where(:created_at => 10.days.ago).peek\n# instead of\n@users = User.active.where(:created_at => 10.days.ago)\nputs @users.inspect\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fdebbd3543c15100bc26"}, "issue_id": 7243, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7472563", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7243#issuecomment-7472563", "updated_at": "2012-08-03T00:39:39Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu", "login": "sikachu", "gravatar_id": "f1c4a3bb1606cc4a61711e61e2fe6146", "html_url": "https://github.com/sikachu", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f1c4a3bb1606cc4a61711e61e2fe6146?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a4526b1ec301744aba9526d78fcb2a6.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 4912, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sikachu/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-03T00:39:39Z", "id": 7472563, "owner": "rails"}
