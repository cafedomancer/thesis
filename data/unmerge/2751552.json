You currently can't remove, rename, or 'alter' impacted sequences -- it's a one way migration, and one you might not catch until it already goes to prod.\r\n\r\nIf you've already migrated a migration with this issue, the only way to fix it is to manually log into the database to manually undo the index then remove/change the migration(file) that added the 'too long index' (and then do you remove the migration from the rollback sequence?).  \r\n\r\nWith the fix, theoretically, this should be raised in a development database migration without messing up prod.
