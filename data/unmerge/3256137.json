{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/4124", "repo": "rails", "body": "I think, that there isn\u2019t need to change compression level. There are only 2 common cases:\r\n1. Cache page expire more than 1 in minute. If we haven\u2019t resources to best compression, we just disable file compression in Rails and use web  server to gzip stream content.\r\n2. Cache page expires less than 1 in minute. It will be better to use best compression.\r\n\r\nOf cource, we can imaginate real optimization geek, who try to find best time/size compression level for each page :). For this guys it will be better to disable build-in gzip and just write simple after filter with they own compression.\r\n\r\nSo we just make code more difficult for very very rare situations (when we need middle compression level).\r\n\r\nBut, of cource, it isn\u2019t difficult to add compression levels. But maybe it will be better to set level in global config?", "_id": {"$oid": "52382c3dbd3543c15100f1b4"}, "issue_id": 4124, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3256137", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4124#issuecomment-3256137", "updated_at": "2011-12-22T23:10:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ai/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ai/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ai/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ai/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ai", "login": "ai", "gravatar_id": "cd32d17c95d3bfb352504c36462b98bd", "html_url": "https://github.com/ai", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ai/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ai/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ai/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/cd32d17c95d3bfb352504c36462b98bd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9bf08b89c0e51a76faafdefb8b089097.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 19343, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ai/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-22T23:10:23Z", "id": 3256137, "owner": "rails"}
