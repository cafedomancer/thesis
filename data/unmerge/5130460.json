Because it would make them think about best practices of modern web development from get go. And if they wish to ignore the best practice, javascript can be moved back into head in just 2secs;  so the beginner's confusion argument seem as an non-issue.\r\n\r\nBut doing this change, we would be promoting \"best practices\" which would be cool. And just to mention; Clean, Semantic and accessible HTML with cached, external JS and CSS trumps inline-stuff every day. \r\n\r\nPS: this is my humble opinion,  please feel free to disagree", "_id": {"$oid": "5238128abd3543c15100d992"}, "issue_id": 5815, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5130460", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5815#issuecomment-5130460", "updated_at": "2012-04-14T10:47:46Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish", "login": "gaurish", "gravatar_id": "cb0b42e452cd13d469565a23a8abe441", "html_url": "https://github.com/gaurish", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/cb0b42e452cd13d469565a23a8abe441?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F58861ae4fb7b472c95e64685229ad9ed.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 235844, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gaurish/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-14T10:45:23Z", "id": 5130460, "owner": "rails"}
