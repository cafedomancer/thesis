{"body": "@jeremy, I looked at this again and I still think `Duration` should subclass `Object` as it did in the other pull.  `Duration#tap` doesn't work as expected either when `ActiveSupport::BasicObject` is subclassed:\r\n\r\n    irb> 1.days.is_a?(ActiveSupport::Duration)\r\n    => true\r\n    irb> 1.days.tap {|d| puts d.is_a?(ActiveSupport::Duration) }\r\n    false\r\n    => 86400\r\n    irb> 1.days.tap {|d| d }.is_a?(ActiveSupport::Duration)\r\n    => false\r\n\r\nI understand that `Duration` should proxy a lot of its methods to its `@value`, but doesn't it make more sense to explicitly delegate the methods in `Object.instance_methods - ActiveSupport::BasicObject.instance_methods` that we want proxied.  That way everything we want to be proxied is, but basic assumptions about `try`, `send`, `tap`, etc aren't violated.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2361467", "created_at": "2011-10-11T13:47:27Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/320#issuecomment-2361467", "updated_at": "2011-10-11T13:47:27Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 320, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/misfo", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/cee19a4eb998343e677f7f1cfd4de5bb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F03300a14fb9934cc5c613e26bdfbaab8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/received_events", "gravatar_id": "cee19a4eb998343e677f7f1cfd4de5bb", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "misfo", "type": "User", "id": 40791, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/misfo/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238623bbd3543c1510123d3"}, "id": 2361467, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/320"}
