Perhaps `doc/guides` and `doc/api` might be better candidates, but even then, how often does someone generate those docs in their app? If I absolutely need to generate those docs (and most people don't, since most people have more reliable internet than I do lol) I run `rails new docapp` to create a bare app just for that purpose and add the necessary gems to the `Gemfile` (like RedCloth for guides) so I can keep it separate from any actual apps.", "_id": {"$oid": "523831c8bd3543c15100f7f2"}, "issue_id": 3777, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4672907", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3777#issuecomment-4672907", "updated_at": "2012-03-24T10:54:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512", "login": "stevenh512", "gravatar_id": "b3e25a674fe385ec5d985c8adf8d60aa", "html_url": "https://github.com/stevenh512", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b3e25a674fe385ec5d985c8adf8d60aa?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Feb5bc262e55ae62defb5de04c8848a90.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 110500, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/stevenh512/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-24T10:53:27Z", "id": 4672907, "owner": "rails"}
