Perhaps `doc/guides` and `doc/api` might be better candidates, but even then, how often does someone generate those docs in their app? If I absolutely need to generate those docs (and most people don't, since most people have more reliable internet than I do lol) I run `rails new docapp` to create a bare app just for that purpose and add the necessary gems to the `Gemfile` (like RedCloth for guides) so I can keep it separate from any actual apps.", "_id": {"$oid": "523831c8bd3543c15100f7f2"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3777#issuecomment-4672907"}
