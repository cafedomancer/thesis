The original commit is gone but a blog post mentions it: http://yehudakatz.com/2009/01/03/todays-dispatch-weaning-actionview-off-of-content-negotiation/\r\n\r\nI am still trying to wrap my head around this. It seems the AbstractController will set this array, but of this array only the first format is actually used. See actionpack/lib/action_view/template.rb:151-158. So for now the solution seems to be to inspect the first format, via the type method, and don't escape when this is text/plain.\r\n\r\nFor most parts I am assuming things, so any input is appreciated. I will work on a patch later today.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f725bd3543c15100af9c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7976#issuecomment-9529263"}
