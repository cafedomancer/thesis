{"body": "The API you are referring to is template.formats (not template.format, that is an internal construct), introduced by Yehuda. The original commit is gone but a blog post mentions it: http://yehudakatz.com/2009/01/03/todays-dispatch-weaning-actionview-off-of-content-negotiation/\r\n\r\nI am still trying to wrap my head around this. It seems the AbstractController will set this array, but of this array only the first format is actually used. See actionpack/lib/action_view/template.rb:151-158. So for now the solution seems to be to inspect the first format, via the type method, and don't escape when this is text/plain.\r\n\r\nFor most parts I am assuming things, so any input is appreciated. I will work on a patch later today.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9529263", "created_at": "2012-10-17T14:29:44Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7976#issuecomment-9529263", "updated_at": "2012-10-17T14:29:44Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 7976, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilsammans/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilsammans/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilsammans/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilsammans", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilsammans/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/tilsammans", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilsammans/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://identicons.github.com/f31bad5d6425dd6d172c786a1bffe4a7.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilsammans/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilsammans/received_events", "gravatar_id": null, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilsammans/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "tilsammans", "type": "User", "id": 14680, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilsammans/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f725bd3543c15100af9c"}, "id": 9529263, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7976"}
