Given the very large scope of this PR could this be a right time to discuss extension vs composition?\r\n\r\nI've seen some feedback of people discussing that directly subclassing from `ActiveRecord::Base` goes counter to Domain-Driven Design, under which class hierarchy should be driven by the problem domain rather than technical implementation. Under this school of thought, the following would be preferable:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Person\r\n  # Person is the root object under the problem domain.\r\n  # The fact it uses AR::Base as a persistence implementation, shouldn't drive the domain class hierarchy.\r\n  include ActiveRecord::Base # Or ApplicationModel\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Client < Person\r\n  # Client is a domain-driven subclass of Person, so it makes sense for it to be an actual subclass\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above would also make it more flexible to use `include` statements either before or after including `ActiveRecord::Base` (or `ApplicationModel`), for more granular control over inclusion order and module hierarchy.\r\n\r\n This change going to be a disruptive change to matter what, so it's a good time as any to discuss what's the best approach.
