{"body": "@softwaregravy After some thought on the original discussion, I think that the `max_records` approach may be hard for you to find where to start the other batches / workers.\r\n\r\nI think there might be a way to achieve the results you expect with a `where` approach, something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWorker A: where(id: 1..20_000).find_in_batches...\r\nWorder B: where(id: 20_001..40_000).find_in_batches...\r\n...\r\nup to 5 workers (or more if you want).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat does give you the requirement of having 20K - more or less, or any count - records by batch. I've already created a similar approach with different priorities and slices by `:id`, and it worked quite fine.
