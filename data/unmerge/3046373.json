The latter's use case is self-evident. One such case is for large pages of records in administrative interfaces and reporting. Even find_in_batches won't beat the performance/memory savings of Valium. \r\n\r\nI'd propose the former is an issue of correctness more than necessity, but again, in such cases as those outlined above, it would be useful to get access to attributes stored in a serialized column (user preferences, for instance) in their intended object.
