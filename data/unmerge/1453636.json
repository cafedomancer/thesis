This would require a large thought process change, as applications would be generated, by default, with a list of [all the gems](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/rails.gemspec#L20-26) that Rails depends on.\r\n\r\nOf course, this would mean that you would need to run `bundle install` on a \"full\" application to get all those little gems like `activerecord` or `activesupport` that you would normally get \"for free\" by installing the `rails` gem. Alternatively, you could still install these manually using `gem install activerecord`.\r\n\r\nI agree with you though, this would lessen the number of gems that Bundler had to look up and really decrease that \"dead weight\" mentioned a few times already. Patches very, very welcome.\r\n\r\nFinally:\r\n\r\n> I sincerely hope I didn't earn a spot in your kill-file for bulldogging you on such a simple little thing). So I'll drop it.\r\n\r\nPeople earn a spot in my \"kill-file\" for being outright assholes, immature or just plain annoying. Your concern is valid and appreciated, and so you're not even close to being in there.
