{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5639", "repo": "rails", "body": "@joeellis there's already `Post.where(title: 'lol').first_or_create` or `Post.where(title: 'lol').first_or_initialize` in rails 3. Which are quite preferable to `Post.find_or_create_by_title(\"lol\")` in my eyes, especially when you have multiple conditions. So much so that I went through and changed our entire codebases to use the new syntax just for `find_or_create_by_*` calls. :smile:", "_id": {"$oid": "523814d7bd3543c15100dc54"}, "issue_id": 5639, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4776048", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5639#issuecomment-4776048", "updated_at": "2012-03-28T18:03:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius", "login": "caius", "gravatar_id": "ad072c8b8e23a18a49eddb6517490fa1", "html_url": "https://github.com/caius", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ad072c8b8e23a18a49eddb6517490fa1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0cb929eae7a499e50248a3a78f7acfc7.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 696, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-28T18:03:20Z", "id": 4776048, "owner": "rails"}
