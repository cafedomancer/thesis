{"body": "@joeellis there's already `Post.where(title: 'lol').first_or_create` or `Post.where(title: 'lol').first_or_initialize` in rails 3. Which are quite preferable to `Post.find_or_create_by_title(\"lol\")` in my eyes, especially when you have multiple conditions. So much so that I went through and changed our entire codebases to use the new syntax just for `find_or_create_by_*` calls. :smile:", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4776048", "created_at": "2012-03-28T18:03:20Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5639#issuecomment-4776048", "updated_at": "2012-03-28T18:03:20Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5639, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/caius", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ad072c8b8e23a18a49eddb6517490fa1?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0cb929eae7a499e50248a3a78f7acfc7.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/received_events", "gravatar_id": "ad072c8b8e23a18a49eddb6517490fa1", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "caius", "type": "User", "id": 696, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/caius/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523814d7bd3543c15100dc54"}, "id": 4776048, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5639"}
