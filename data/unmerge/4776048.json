Which are quite preferable to `Post.find_or_create_by_title(\"lol\")` in my eyes, especially when you have multiple conditions. So much so that I went through and changed our entire codebases to use the new syntax just for `find_or_create_by_*` calls. :smile:", "_id": {"$oid": "523814d7bd3543c15100dc54"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5639#issuecomment-4776048"}
