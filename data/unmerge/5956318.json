However, the left side is meant to be a path, passing a path as a symbol seems weird and unnecessary to me. I prefer the consistency of having all my paths as strings. Notice that your patch is also backwards invalid and dependent on the hash order, because one can do: `get :index => \"a#b\", :as => \"a_b\"`. Now you have two symbols and you don't know which one is meant to be the path.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380748bd3543c15100ca6d"}, "issue_id": 6508, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5956318", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6508#issuecomment-5956318", "updated_at": "2012-05-27T20:51:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-27T20:51:32Z", "id": 5956318, "owner": "rails"}
