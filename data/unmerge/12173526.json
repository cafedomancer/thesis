I understand you wouldn't necessarily want them to be *exactly* like hashes (because they aren't), but when you are retrieving single keys all of the time (like a hash), I would expect to be able to fetch them (like a hash) since the feeling of `cookies` is similar to `Hash` in this particular way.\r\n\r\nI'm not looking to make this a full-blown `Hash`, but this is potentially a useful little method for those looking to do something a little more dynamic or complicated with the `cookies`.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237eedbbd3543c15100a049"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8900#issuecomment-12173526"}
