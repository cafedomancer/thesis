I understand you wouldn't necessarily want them to be *exactly* like hashes (because they aren't), but when you are retrieving single keys all of the time (like a hash), I would expect to be able to fetch them (like a hash) since the feeling of `cookies` is similar to `Hash` in this particular way.\r\n\r\nI'm not looking to make this a full-blown `Hash`, but this is potentially a useful little method for those looking to do something a little more dynamic or complicated with the `cookies`.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237eedbbd3543c15100a049"}, "issue_id": 8900, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12173526", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8900#issuecomment-12173526", "updated_at": "2013-01-12T04:39:19Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges", "login": "mattdbridges", "gravatar_id": "fa4b5f21ddfec459b530bfce99079e54", "html_url": "https://github.com/mattdbridges", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/fa4b5f21ddfec459b530bfce99079e54?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0f3da53df1c3935c37f47ffbc13d554b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 442443, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mattdbridges/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-12T04:39:19Z", "id": 12173526, "owner": "rails"}
