However, we make these choices for a principled reason, not just because it seems RESTful.\r\n\r\nIn the text of that post:\r\n\r\n> ... complete replacement of a representation (PUT), \r\n\r\nThe text of the PATCH RFC, which is again, just a draft:\r\n\r\n>  The PUT method is already defined to overwrite a resource\r\n>   with a complete new body, and cannot be reused to do partial changes.\r\n\r\nMy point is this: there's overwhelming consensus that PUT means 'whole representation.' Well, modified consensus, since it's not 100%. ;) However, it is true that PATCH is a draft standard, so I can see not implementing it in Rails. That's quite valid. However, continuing to use PUT is also wrong. If it's a partial update, POST makes much more sense.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012121"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3149840", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3149840", "updated_at": "2011-12-14T21:08:13Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "login": "steveklabnik", "gravatar_id": "233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0c22d45f31acf0f4192c8c12b7a55dee.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 27786, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-14T21:08:13Z", "id": 3149840, "owner": "rails"}
