That commit added the ability to perform mass assignments on nested models, and this commit provides a patch to ensure that you can enable that through accepts_nested_attributes_for instead of directly hitting #{association}_attributes= with :without_protection => true.\r\n\r\nSee the following in the aforementioned commit.\r\n\r\n    def unassignable_keys(assignment_opts)\r\n      assignment_opts[:without_protection] ? UNASSIGNABLE_KEYS - %w[id] : UNASSIGNABLE_KEYS\r\n    end\r\n\r\nMy primary use case is the ability to specify a primary key through mass assignment on the nested association.\r\n\r\nWhere should I be putting the docs?", "_id": {"$oid": "52384bc5bd3543c1510113c9"}, "issue_id": 1944, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1491307", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1944#issuecomment-1491307", "updated_at": "2011-07-03T03:44:48Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cmeiklejohn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cmeiklejohn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cmeiklejohn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cmeiklejohn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cmeiklejohn", "login": "cmeiklejohn", "gravatar_id": "3e09fee7b359be847ed5fa48f524a3d3", "html_url": "https://github.com/cmeiklejohn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cmeiklejohn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cmeiklejohn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cmeiklejohn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3e09fee7b359be847ed5fa48f524a3d3?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7cbabebc4ff57faf9cd22b4188243793.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cmeiklejohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 44939, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cmeiklejohn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-07-03T03:44:48Z", "id": 1491307, "owner": "rails"}
