This is basically a continuation of [5d655aabcb47a68e7ce1dfb60222e951a6d30169].  That commit added the ability to perform mass assignments on nested models, and this commit provides a patch to ensure that you can enable that through accepts_nested_attributes_for instead of directly hitting #{association}_attributes= with :without_protection => true.\r\n\r\nSee the following in the aforementioned commit.\r\n\r\n    def unassignable_keys(assignment_opts)\r\n      assignment_opts[:without_protection] ? UNASSIGNABLE_KEYS - %w[id] : UNASSIGNABLE_KEYS\r\n    end\r\n\r\nMy primary use case is the ability to specify a primary key through mass assignment on the nested association.\r\n\r\nWhere should I be putting the docs?", "_id": {"$oid": "52384bc5bd3543c1510113c9"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1944#issuecomment-1491307"}
