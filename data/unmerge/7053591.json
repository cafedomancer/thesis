I'm just trying to continue the discussion that's been going on for the past few comments here. I understand that the huge initializer is unappealing. However, I think there are other options still worth discussing. At the least, is the major 4.0 release _not_ a good chance to fix the inflections that are odd and _can_ be better? And in the case of indices or indexes, isn't that exactly the kind of special case that you guys are saying Rails _shouldn't_ handle?", "_id": {"$oid": "52380016bd3543c15100bf40"}, "issue_id": 7071, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7053591", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7071#issuecomment-7053591", "updated_at": "2012-07-18T00:27:03Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis", "login": "davidcelis", "gravatar_id": "9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidcelis", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3e1a626a9e0c39eb548886c253bf9644.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 36873, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-18T00:25:01Z", "id": 7053591, "owner": "rails"}
