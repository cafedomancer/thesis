Yes, you should namespace and build engines, and use configuration, inheritance, whatever you fancy.\r\n\r\nBut then there is real life and sometimes you want to monkey patch an engine or you need to develop against an engine that does not provide the proper abstraction, that's when this pull request comes in hand.
