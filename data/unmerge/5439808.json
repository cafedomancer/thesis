{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2890", "repo": "rails", "body": "I've rebased the patch locally and tested, and it works. What I'm thinking about is that we already have a way to fallback using i18n and `config.i18n.fallbacks = true`, which could most likely solve the problem by returning the defaults in case none is found.\r\n\r\nIf that does not solve, I'd propose fallbacking manually to `:en`, the one we are sure that come with the framework, instead of having constants. I've tested and seems to work fine.
