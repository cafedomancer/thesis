Breaking API compatibility for a tiny amount of CPU cycles in a language that's optimized for programmer happiness rather than performance is the kind of optimization that wasn't worth 0aa66f0 in the first place.\r\n\r\nAnd saying the compatibility wasn't in the contract because the word **true** wasn't in a fixed-width font is pretty mind-boggling when the documentation clearly says it returns **true**.\r\n\r\nI guess we just have differing opinions.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your great work on Rails, but I hope you can really think about this kind of issue and take a more sensible approach in the future.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e22a"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4670128", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4670128", "updated_at": "2012-03-23T23:55:38Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton", "login": "clifton", "gravatar_id": "4cede21ea96795d2de831e9981cc81cd", "html_url": "https://github.com/clifton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4cede21ea96795d2de831e9981cc81cd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc27181a18d3b30d14d66a1a56c068548.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 14217, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-23T23:55:19Z", "id": 4670128, "owner": "rails"}
