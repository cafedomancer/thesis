I made the change that I did to try and keep it small and focused rather than a (much) larger patch to decouple it completely from the connection.  But I also think that is the right approach rather than having dependencies on the middleware (or some helper class).  The other way to look at this is to not have ActiveRecord::Base.connection actually trigger a db call until used, but again, I think that is a thornier change outside of the scope\r\n\r\n* I looked at that, but the reason I kept it general is that the exceptions that are thrown are direct from the driver and are quite varied in type.
