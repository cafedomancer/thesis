Most webservers (like webrick) will return a default 500. If we want better integration with this I could do some refactoring on the current errors middleware and have it try to use the dynamic page, but rescue to static. I've been using some form of dynamic error pages for every project that has been public for the last 5 years, i've never needed a fallback. \n\nAnother use case for dynamic error pages: Different content for different users: i.e. you can give admin user's debug info: https://speakerdeck.com/u/schneems/p/millions-of-apps-deployed-presented-at-lsrc?slide=116", "_id": {"$oid": "523dcb02bd354364b900a100"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7772#issuecomment-8942909"}
