A file `tmp/foo.rb` would *not* be ignored by `git` using the old gitignore file, and I thought that was a mistake. (That is, I'm still assuming that whoever wrote the original gitignore file wanted to ignore the tmp directory and anything in it, to whatever depth.)", "_id": {"$oid": "523866c3bd3543c151012840"}, "issue_id": 164, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/726698", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/164#issuecomment-726698", "updated_at": "2011-01-31T22:41:38Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/telemachus/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/telemachus/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/telemachus/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/telemachus/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/telemachus", "login": "telemachus", "gravatar_id": "d88863757d1f37a2f61bf2bda6516524", "html_url": "https://github.com/telemachus", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/telemachus/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/telemachus/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/telemachus/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d88863757d1f37a2f61bf2bda6516524?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe1e836ffc564e8237e4d2e87fac2bdbc.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/telemachus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 62958, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/telemachus/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-01-31T22:39:37Z", "id": 726698, "owner": "rails"}
