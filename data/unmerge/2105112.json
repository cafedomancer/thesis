Seems like there are a couple issues with doing that:\r\n\r\n1. My deployment user may not have permission to edit the web server configuration files at deployment time\r\n\r\n2. The web server might need to be restarted to pick up the changes (or at very least have its configuration reloaded), which could cause some downtime (granted, probably only seconds, but it impacts the idea of deploying under load)\r\n\r\n3. If I had hundreds of files I needed to do this with, that could make for a pretty long web server config file. Not sure the impact of that, other than feeling wrong.\r\n\r\nIt also \"feels\" complex.\r\n\r\nSome alternative ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Change `config.assets.digest` to take one of `:none`, `:digest`, or `:both` - the first two would correspond to the current false/true options, and the last one would mean assets would be compiled/copied both with and without digests. I realize this copies a lot of files around, but I like this idea the best from the perspective of keeping things simple.\r\n\r\n2. Create symlinks to link from non-digest to digest assets. Somewhat platform-dependent (e.g. problematic on windows).\r\n\r\n3. Have an array to define which assets should additionally be copied without digests; something like `config.assets.no_digest += ['logo.png', 'theme/*.png']`.  Feels kinda kludgy.\r\n\r\nI should add that the way 3.1.1 stands at the moment, it's going to break for people using, say, jquery-ui themes, in that their theme-specific images are not going to load with the rails default settings, unless they put the theme into the public directory.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52383e0abd3543c15101053e"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2886#issuecomment-2105112"}
