It's a nice pattern for your case, but agreed with @egilburg that it doesn't fit within `delegate`'s domain. Better to create a new DSL-like declaration for your case than to push its scope even further, considering it's already been saddled with too much complexity.\r\n\r\nAnother way to approach your model is to wrap your polymorphic targets with presenter classes. The presenter may take the responsibility of implementing the complete interface and return \"N/A\" or whatever default where appropriate.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d05bbd3543c151007c97"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11908#issuecomment-22745547"}
