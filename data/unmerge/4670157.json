Just because returning `0` is a valid response, doesn't mean it's ideal. As others have pointed out, Ruby allows certain things that are not ideal. That doesn't mean we should do them. It seems like you are holding your ground on this merely because technically it is ok, even if it is not actually the clearest thing to do. If your response was \"yes, this is confusing, but `!!` is no better\" then I would understand and I would hope that together we could all find a better solution. I think we need to keep the principle of least surprise in mind here.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e22c"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4670157"}
