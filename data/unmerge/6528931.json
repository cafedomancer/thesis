The only possible effect is that we are still going to make people believe there is *correct* time support for SQLite when there isn't (MySQL and PostgreSQL are fine, tho).\n\nIn any case, we're also faking it on Ruby since Ruby doesn't support Time with time only (I'm just defaulting the date to be `January 1, 1970`.\n\nBtw, I haven't created the PR on master already because of this issue, if you guys decide we undo the other PR I can create a new one targeted against master with the SQLite change added.", "_id": {"$oid": "523803a7bd3543c15100c478"}, "issue_id": 6835, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6528931", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6835#issuecomment-6528931", "updated_at": "2012-06-23T22:38:22Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio", "login": "mauricio", "gravatar_id": "a91bd6cef23eb3516245a092e196c4da", "html_url": "https://github.com/mauricio", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/a91bd6cef23eb3516245a092e196c4da?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc7be03f5d811ed29c328526ca8ab0d61.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5742, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mauricio/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-23T22:38:22Z", "id": 6528931, "owner": "rails"}
