Though I don't think the scenario you outlined is supported -- [the docs](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Serializers/JSON.html#method-i-as_json) say that `:include` is for including associations (defined by `has_many`, `has_one`, etc), not arbitrary relations. This approach might work better:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Widget < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :parts\r\n  has_many :special_parts, conditions: { is_special: true }, class_name: 'Part'\r\nend\r\n\r\n> Widget.first.as_json(include: :special_parts)\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "5238472ebd3543c151011055"}, "issue_id": 2200, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20372174", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2200#issuecomment-20372174", "updated_at": "2013-07-02T20:08:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/grantovich/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/grantovich/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/grantovich/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/grantovich/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/grantovich", "login": "grantovich", "gravatar_id": "b6c92201404bd9b616fbba5e783cb3d8", "html_url": "https://github.com/grantovich", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/grantovich/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/grantovich/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/grantovich/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b6c92201404bd9b616fbba5e783cb3d8?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F50bf48b85ed71ba0f25be359e2495785.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/grantovich/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 394835, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/grantovich/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-02T20:08:20Z", "id": 20372174, "owner": "rails"}
