{"body": "That does seem like a separate issue. Though I don't think the scenario you outlined is supported -- [the docs](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Serializers/JSON.html#method-i-as_json) say that `:include` is for including associations (defined by `has_many`, `has_one`, etc), not arbitrary relations.
