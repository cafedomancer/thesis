{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6685", "repo": "rails", "body": "Let me propose an idea, just to try to give a new perspective to this. What if we rename this to `boot_strategy`? Possible values could be, say, `:lazy`, or `:eager`. With the natural defaults. The documentation of each one in particular would say something about thread-safety, *as anything else should*.\n\nOf course taking backwards compatibility into account etc. I mean, modulus details, what if we move the focus to how the application boots, and include thread-safety documentation as a normal thing? Sounds bad? Sounds good?\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c71b"}, "issue_id": 6685, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6484794", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6484794", "updated_at": "2012-06-21T15:15:38Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-21T15:15:38Z", "id": 6484794, "owner": "rails"}
