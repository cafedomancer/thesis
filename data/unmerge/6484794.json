What if we rename this to `boot_strategy`? Possible values could be, say, `:lazy`, or `:eager`. With the natural defaults. The documentation of each one in particular would say something about thread-safety, *as anything else should*.\n\nOf course taking backwards compatibility into account etc. I mean, modulus details, what if we move the focus to how the application boots, and include thread-safety documentation as a normal thing? Sounds bad? Sounds good?\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c71b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6484794"}
