For instance, =~ returns a useful value and can also be used to get the position of the match. In the case of xhr?, the return value is just noise and breaks encapsulation, revealing implementation detail unnecessarily. It is also a performance issue to rely on returning truthy values, since useless truthy values in many case are more expensive to serialize or pass by value.\r\n\r\nRails core preference for trivialy simplifying the rails code at the expense of providing the clearest public interface possible is disappointing, and frankly contrary to the way most of Rails is written. Insistence that those who find the return value confusing \"learn Ruby\" goes against what many consider to be a mission of Rails - to make web development more accessible by reducing cognitive clutter of old frameworks. By admission of both those for and against, this definitely increases necessary knowledge of Ruby without any benefit. \r\n\r\nMy philosophy on boolean APIs is that they should return true or false unless there is a documented reason to diverge from this pattern to double purpose the API, eg =~. \r\n\r\nI'm confident once egos are checked, that this is the correct course. In the meantime, while this is a trivial issue, it goes to the core of what Rails is and how decisions are made. This decision strikes me as dictatorial, unpopular, ego laden, and likely wrong. It makes me a little bit sad. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523815d4bd3543c15100dda1"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5572#issuecomment-5032787"}
