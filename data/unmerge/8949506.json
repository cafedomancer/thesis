Generating files that goes against that convention seems bad for a convention-over-configuration advocacy standpoint. A controller-view-route is the minimum required to deliver a generated webpage (with a template) using Rails. \n\nWe can remove the `resources :pages` in the routes along with the show action, it is noise in this PR.
