I want the user to have ability to pass any cookie jar to it:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyLibrary\r\n  def initialize(cookies)\r\n    @cookies = cookies\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def do_something_useful\r\n    @cookies.delete(:wrong_key)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# in controller\r\nMyLibrary.new(cookies).do_something_useful\r\nMyLibrary.new(cookies.signed).do_something_useful\r\n```", "_id": {"$oid": "5238049fbd3543c15100c60f"}, "issue_id": 6745, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11763579", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6745#issuecomment-11763579", "updated_at": "2012-12-30T11:12:56Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxposter/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxposter/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxposter/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxposter/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxposter", "login": "fxposter", "gravatar_id": "8cbd31fea81477c4b353eb32209df69f", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxposter", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxposter/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxposter/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxposter/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/8cbd31fea81477c4b353eb32209df69f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F781beb7ff9b4072e3171ed7f8b5f32d2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxposter/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 109216, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxposter/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-30T11:12:56Z", "id": 11763579, "owner": "rails"}
