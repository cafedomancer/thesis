From what I can tell what you did seems to make perfect sense for *your* use case, and that's great.\n\nThe problem is, that seems to be a very specific use case for your own app, and even for the few other comments on this thread that might find this useful, it appears that they needed something slightly different from what you have here. Since this won't be useful to that many people, you're probably better off placing that in your app's lib directory.\n\nOn the other hand, if you could get some generic [traversal iterator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Recursive_Traversals_in_C) going for Enumerable, THAT would be pretty useful. Heck if you could figure out a reasonable API for that perhaps it should even go into Ruby 2.0 ;) ", "_id": {"$oid": "523800dcbd3543c15100c067"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7008#issuecomment-6981202"}
