{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5329", "repo": "rails", "body": "Call me crazy, but if people who wish to contribute to, or read, rails' source code, can't be bothered to perform the mental hurdles to understand a `!!` in ruby code (which, imo, is relatively idiomatic in and of itself), then we've got bigger problems. But that's not what this thread is really about.\r\n\r\nThis thread devolved into a largely theoretical argument about what predicate methods in ruby code should/shouldn't do, and whether theoretical code should/shouldn't expect certain values from methods, and method contracts, encapsulation, etc. All good arguments that never should have had to be made. This should have been a trivial commit, but for some reason we're still talking about it. There are more important problems to solve than this. :sadpanda:\r\n\r\nStill, I'd be remiss if I didn't color my criticism of rails core with a great deal of thanks for the hard work you do. So thanks!\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e242"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4670421", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4670421", "updated_at": "2012-03-24T00:31:11Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ajsharp/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ajsharp/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ajsharp/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ajsharp/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ajsharp", "login": "ajsharp", "gravatar_id": "e4f80e42794094c98a40bfebef4ec292", "html_url": "https://github.com/ajsharp", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ajsharp/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ajsharp/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ajsharp/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e4f80e42794094c98a40bfebef4ec292?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd0aae9539e4dd0bd618e5d2598f18707.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ajsharp/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 12774, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ajsharp/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-24T00:31:11Z", "id": 4670421, "owner": "rails"}
