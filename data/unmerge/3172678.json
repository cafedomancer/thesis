While not totally damning, I think it's also a strong supporting line of reasoning.\r\n\r\n2) Rails hasn't suffered for 'implementing PUT wrong' (really app dev's fault, but assisted by Rails' shoddy defaults) because Rails apps haven't been receiving PUT requests: they receive POST requests with a `_method` parameter saying PUT.
