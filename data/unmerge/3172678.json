While not totally damning, I think it's also a strong supporting line of reasoning.\r\n\r\n2) Rails hasn't suffered for 'implementing PUT wrong' (really app dev's fault, but assisted by Rails' shoddy defaults) because Rails apps haven't been receiving PUT requests: they receive POST requests with a `_method` parameter saying PUT. This is basically exactly what I'm saying should happen with the removal of support for PATCH but without the extra parameter, pretending to be a PUT.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c15101212e"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3172678", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3172678", "updated_at": "2011-12-16T03:02:44Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik", "login": "steveklabnik", "gravatar_id": "233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7", "html_url": "https://github.com/steveklabnik", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/233c279c012ebac792aaa805f966cbc7?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0c22d45f31acf0f4192c8c12b7a55dee.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 27786, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/steveklabnik/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-16T03:02:44Z", "id": 3172678, "owner": "rails"}
