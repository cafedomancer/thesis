{"body": "@mikekelly I think 2616 is clear enough on the issue of PUT being full-resource replacements, but just in case it wasn't clear enough, there's also the RFC 5789 to make it explicitly clear.\r\n\r\nPIUs, and just partial updates in general, are important, we all agree. That's the whole point of this pull request--let's support the proposed standard of using PATCH to do partial updates.\r\n\r\nPUT mandates idempotent full (non-partial) updates.\r\nPATCH allows full or partial updates, idempotent or not.\r\n\r\n@reschke Yes, a lot of the internet runs on `Proposed Standard`s. That's why we shouldn't dismiss PATCH even though it's a `Proposed Standard`, because it's too restrictive to *only* support `Internet Standard`.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3191836", "created_at": "2011-12-17T22:19:50Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3191836", "updated_at": "2011-12-17T22:19:50Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 505, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/dlee", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/139de3f8c3d6ee008cdb3abd3da23908?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F80177fe965b78111f4dfee80cfdc3689.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/received_events", "gravatar_id": "139de3f8c3d6ee008cdb3abd3da23908", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "dlee", "type": "User", "id": 7035, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dlee/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c15101214b"}, "id": 3191836, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/505"}
