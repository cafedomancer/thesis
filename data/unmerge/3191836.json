That's the whole point of this pull request--let's support the proposed standard of using PATCH to do partial updates.\r\n\r\nPUT mandates idempotent full (non-partial) updates.\r\nPATCH allows full or partial updates, idempotent or not.\r\n\r\n@reschke Yes, a lot of the internet runs on `Proposed Standard`s. That's why we shouldn't dismiss PATCH even though it's a `Proposed Standard`, because it's too restrictive to *only* support `Internet Standard`.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c15101214b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3191836"}
