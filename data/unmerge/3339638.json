That's unavoidable.\n>\n\nManipulating a string is fine, you don't need the encoding tag unless you\nexplicitly add a non-ascii char in the file.\n\n2. Controller method for view display, ex :\n>\n> drop_breadcrumb \"Home\"\n> drop_breadcrumb \"Post List\"\n> drop_breadcrumb \"Post Title\"\n>\n> will render Home >> Post List >> Post Title\n>\n> If we use breadcrumb in View, it will be massy and ULTRA slow. ( write\n> Ruby LOGIC in View is ULTRA slow )\n>\n\nYes, the helpers that have strings like this with non ascii characters do\nneed the encoding tag.\n\n\n> 3. Single language application. Rails's I18n is not that perfect. Usually\n> we don't use I18n in only one-language application. Because if we do, the\n> application will suddenly be massy and unmaintainable. Nobody would want to\n> use I18n since day-one when specs says that is NOT an international\n> application.\n>\n\nI particularly disagree. Regardless if my apps are I18n or not, we use it\nthe maximum we can in our controllers to avoid setting up messages in our\ncontrollers.\n\nNote that all your views are tagged as utf-8 by default by Rails. So from\nall this discussion, I can only see helper files frequently requiring a\nutf8 encoding tag.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238291dbd3543c15100efe9"}, "issue_id": 4271, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3339638", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4271#issuecomment-3339638", "updated_at": "2012-01-03T13:15:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-01-03T13:15:28Z", "id": 3339638, "owner": "rails"}
