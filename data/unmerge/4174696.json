{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5167", "repo": "rails", "body": "I am positive about this patch, this inconsistency is a pain point for me and a major version allows a change like this.\r\n\r\nMost applications depend on the rails gem, so it will be transparent to most users.\r\n\r\nPeople manually loading Active Record or Active Support, say, won't have their apps broken either. On one hand the \"activerecord\" gem won't be updated. If they want to upgrade they will need to fetch the new active_record gem, no big deal. The code is already doing a require \"active_record\" (it does not work without underscore).\r\n\r\nIt may make the patches in some other PRs obsolete perhaps (or perhaps git is able to figure out the renames, I am not sure). But I don't care, I think it is worth it.\r\n\r\nSummary, :+1:.\r\n\r\nWhat do other members of core think?\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52381befbd3543c15100e468"}, "issue_id": 5167, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4174696", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5167#issuecomment-4174696", "updated_at": "2012-02-25T18:07:46Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-02-25T18:07:31Z", "id": 4174696, "owner": "rails"}
