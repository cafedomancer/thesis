In my use case I have settings for an external application that I need to validate but who's name I don't control and will change frequently (so I'd end up with a ton of migrations if I didn't serialize it).\n\nI can of course write my own prefixing/deprefexing code but it will be IMO unnecessary clutter. I know this is not a traditional pure-rails application per-say because I need to interface with a non-db backend but it's exactly the sort of things real-world applications are faced with. Why is rolling our own a better option?\n\n@patrick99e99 could this be packaged as a gem instead?", "_id": {"$oid": "52381b25bd3543c15100e3c1"}, "issue_id": 5217, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8273626", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5217#issuecomment-8273626", "updated_at": "2012-09-04T18:30:56Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/D1plo1d/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/D1plo1d/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/D1plo1d/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/D1plo1d/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/D1plo1d", "login": "D1plo1d", "gravatar_id": "eeabd716b6e14654574b3bb0a1589144", "html_url": "https://github.com/D1plo1d", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/D1plo1d/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/D1plo1d/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/D1plo1d/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/eeabd716b6e14654574b3bb0a1589144?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd551bb4d0927ddcba31e042d93ebf572.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/D1plo1d/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 145184, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/D1plo1d/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-04T18:30:56Z", "id": 8273626, "owner": "rails"}
