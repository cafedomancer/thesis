{"body": "Too bad, prefix would have fit my needs perfectly. In my use case I have settings for an external application that I need to validate but who's name I don't control and will change frequently (so I'd end up with a ton of migrations if I didn't serialize it).\n\nI can of course write my own prefixing/deprefexing code but it will be IMO unnecessary clutter. I know this is not a traditional pure-rails application per-say because I need to interface with a non-db backend but it's exactly the sort of things real-world applications are faced with.
