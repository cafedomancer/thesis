In my use case I have settings for an external application that I need to validate but who's name I don't control and will change frequently (so I'd end up with a ton of migrations if I didn't serialize it).\n\nI can of course write my own prefixing/deprefexing code but it will be IMO unnecessary clutter. I know this is not a traditional pure-rails application per-say because I need to interface with a non-db backend but it's exactly the sort of things real-world applications are faced with. Why is rolling our own a better option?\n\n@patrick99e99 could this be packaged as a gem instead?", "_id": {"$oid": "52381b25bd3543c15100e3c1"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5217#issuecomment-8273626"}
