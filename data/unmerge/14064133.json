In fist case, if failure occurrs during migration then it breaks running and current (failed) migration will rollback all already executed statements (if database supports ddl transactions). \r\nFor example, in your migration, you have two parts: \r\n1) creation of table;\r\n2) adding foreign key to table.\r\nIf, in this case, second step fails migration will be completly cancelled and table creation will be rolled back as well as forign key creation.\r\nBut this works **only** for **db:migrate**.\r\nIf you will try same thing with **db:migrate:up** you face with problem - table will not be removed. If you then fix foreign key creation and try to run same migration again it will fail again with error like \"Table already exists\".", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ea2cbd3543c151009955"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9416#issuecomment-14064133"}
