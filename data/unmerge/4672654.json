I was upset. So I made a pull request as a **wtf?** knee-jerk reaction. The exact way I went about all of this was likely in bad taste.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say I wasn't right. In fact, I'd say I was because @tpope's pull request was merged in over your code as a result.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I love Rails. I helped get a company off the ground (while I was in college without salary) and we have almost 40 employees now. And it's largely in part to a framework you and others contribute to. The work you've done has put a roof over the heads of all those people. That's pretty magical.\r\n\r\nI'd just appreciate if you valued the opinions of others that have been working for years with your framework more. That doesn't make us right all the time, and I could be completely wrong on this issue too, but you've responded in a pretty negative way and written off some really great arguments without addressing them.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e24b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4672654"}
