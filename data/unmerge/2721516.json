{"body": "Yes, we talked about this patch after 3.1 and it is in the \"roadmap\" for 3.2 if it is good to go by then.\r\n\r\n@stevegraham RFCs are not axiomatic systems, but I think there's no controversy in that PUT means \"put this resource at that URL\" (\"The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.\").\r\n\r\nYou're sending the resource itself, and in the target URL you either create a new resource (\"If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.\"), or else replace the existing one (\"If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server.\").\r\n\r\nIt is the app's choice to conform to that spec. Nowadays to do partial updates in a RESTFul way you need to define ad-hoc resources. For example, to toggle the \"paid\" flag of an invoice you may PUT to /invoices/:id/paid, but if you play by the rules you need PATCH for partial updates to /invoices/:id.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2721516", "created_at": "2011-11-13T09:47:36Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-2721516", "updated_at": "2011-11-13T09:57:45Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 505, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "fxn", "type": "User", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c1510120f2"}, "id": 2721516, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/505"}
