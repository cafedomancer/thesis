Nowadays to do partial updates in a RESTFul way you need to define ad-hoc resources. For example, to toggle the \"paid\" flag of an invoice you may PUT to /invoices/:id/paid, but if you play by the rules you need PATCH for partial updates to /invoices/:id.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c1510120f2"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2721516", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-2721516", "updated_at": "2011-11-13T09:57:45Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-13T09:47:36Z", "id": 2721516, "owner": "rails"}
