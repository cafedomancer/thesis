{"body": "I'm sympathetic to @jonleighton's concerns about complexity and serialized attr handling, but looking at the implementation, it's not adding much, and everyone will expect serialized attrs to \"just work.\"\r\n\r\nHaving separate methods makes sense for consistent return values, too (Array of values vs Array of Arrays of values).\r\n\r\nWriting out `account.users.value_of :id` still reads oddly to me. It's asking for a singular value of... a collection. `account.users.pluck :id` has a good, natural feel in comparison.
