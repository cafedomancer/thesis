It's asking for a singular value of... a collection. `account.users.pluck :id` has a good, natural feel in comparison. Maybe a more explicit action would clear this up, like `account.users.select_value :id` to match the Connection API.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f64b"}, "issue_id": 3871, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3220942", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3220942", "updated_at": "2011-12-20T16:14:26Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy", "login": "jeremy", "gravatar_id": "24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremy", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84d9ee44e457ddef7f2c4f25dc8fa865.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 199, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-20T16:14:26Z", "id": 3220942, "owner": "rails"}
