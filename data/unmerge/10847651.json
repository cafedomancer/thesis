The very bored and statistically inclined could figure out how much typing this *costs*...\r\n\r\n* Cost: renders *every* document about AR associations slightly out-of-date. And I mean every one of them - `:class_name` has been an option since [commit zero](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/db045dbbf60b53dbe013ef25554fd013baf88134/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations.rb).\r\n\r\n* Cost: very small but nonzero chance of causing obscure, difficult-to-diagnose load order bugs in upgraded applications.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f3e9bd3543c15100a92d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8357#issuecomment-10847651"}
