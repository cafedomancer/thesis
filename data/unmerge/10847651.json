{"body": "It's possible I was being *slightly* paranoid about the loading issue - but anybody that's ever had to chase down bizarre autoloader behavior (for instance, having a development server that only crashes on the *second* request with the \"removed from the module tree but still active\" exception) is probably equally wary.\r\n\r\nMy concern is more about costs-vs-benefits: making this change appears to have the following breakdown:\r\n\r\n* Benefit: saves a couple characters worth of typing.\r\n\r\n* Cost: triggers deprecation warnings in literally every Rails app that upgrades to Rails 4. The very bored and statistically inclined could figure out how much typing this *costs*...\r\n\r\n* Cost: renders *every* document about AR associations slightly out-of-date.
