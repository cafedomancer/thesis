I also do feel that toward the end of this discussion some of the things I said and my choice of words were also rude and inappropriate. That I do apologize for, it was said out of frustration, but that's no excuse.\r\n\r\nI also can't apologize for saying I was lied to. When someone tells me (and he was responding to my comment when he said it) that they are going to do something that they actually have no intention of doing, that person is lying directly to me.. so yes, I was directly lied to and I would be a liar myself if I said otherwise.", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd52"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4713249"}
