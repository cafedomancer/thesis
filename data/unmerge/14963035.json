The PR was closed though and you can read up on the reasons here  #3989.\r\n\r\nAs it is a resubmission I'm closing the issue but feel free to ping me if you have questions.\r\nIf you want to propose new features for Rails you can also use the [Rails core mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-core) to get feedback from core members before you have to write the actual code.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nYves", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e76fbd3543c151009590"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9689#issuecomment-14963035"}
