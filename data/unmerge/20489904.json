Once we realized we should escape it and then fixed it, we noticed some clients were escaping it again...\r\n\r\nThe theory is great, but in practice, some software somewhere is going to make sure it doesn't work as expected. Regardless, @xuanxu could you please tell us more on how to reproduce the failure you are seeing?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237d684bd3543c1510082c9"}, "issue_id": 11296, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/20489904", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/11296#issuecomment-20489904", "updated_at": "2013-07-04T18:55:39Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-07-04T18:55:39Z", "id": 20489904, "owner": "rails"}
