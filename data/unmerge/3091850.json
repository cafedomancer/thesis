We have recently pushed a commit to Rails that logs every time a callback redirects or renders:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/commit/38ab982cfff98570b5f12933cff489364845789c\r\n\r\nThis should already help your students to identify what was changing the request. The second point that callbacks can be messy to understand in big applications is also valid but I am afraid logging each callback could be unnecessarily expensive. So maybe we could merge your patch but without a default implementation for log_callback. If one desires, he coud then override and implement it as needed.\r\n\r\n/cc @jeremy @wycats", "_id": {"$oid": "52382fabbd3543c15100f584"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3929#issuecomment-3091850"}
