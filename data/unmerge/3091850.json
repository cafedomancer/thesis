{"body": "Thanks for the pull request! We have recently pushed a commit to Rails that logs every time a callback redirects or renders:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/commit/38ab982cfff98570b5f12933cff489364845789c\r\n\r\nThis should already help your students to identify what was changing the request. The second point that callbacks can be messy to understand in big applications is also valid but I am afraid logging each callback could be unnecessarily expensive. So maybe we could merge your patch but without a default implementation for log_callback. If one desires, he coud then override and implement it as needed.\r\n\r\n/cc @jeremy @wycats", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3091850", "created_at": "2011-12-10T17:24:26Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3929#issuecomment-3091850", "updated_at": "2011-12-10T17:24:26Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3929, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "josevalim", "type": "User", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52382fabbd3543c15100f584"}, "id": 3091850, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3929"}
