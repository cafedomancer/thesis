As a user who hit this on unnamed indexes (auto-named), it was incredibly confusing because at the time I didn't know how Rails named indexes.\n\nNot sure I was clear enough, I believe that having two indexes being automatically truncated with the same name may be confusing for us developers when catching such issue.\n\n> This will prevent rails from throwing up when certain migrations would cause them to go over the limit by prefixing \"temp_\".\n\nI don't see Rails prefixing things with `temp_`.\n\n> Having an index which is 59-64 characters long is an error, it's just a matter of how and when you hit it. This argument put forth on this thread is that it is better to catch the error when trying to create the index in the first place than wait for it to blow up later.\n\nExactly, the idea is that Rails will raise in case the index name gets longer than that, to avoid possible problems later. This should happen *during migration* time, not later on. So, when you add an index, and run your migration, it should blow up with an exception saying the name is too long, no matter if it was automatically generated or manually added. If it was manually, you just go there and change. If it was automatically, you have to add a manual `:name`. That's my thought, of course there may be other approaches, but I feel ok with that.", "_id": {"$oid": "523fe6c0bd354364b901c1cd"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1993#issuecomment-6506891"}
