{"body": "@injekt is right\u2014English just isn't structured to encapsulate \"not in\" or \"missing from\" as a single world. One could invent a new pseudo-word that has all of the other desirable properties (except being a real word): `#nin?`.\r\n\r\nI also tend to agree with @jfirebaugh: `#either?` makes no sense for calls with an arity other than 2. I think `#one_of` and `#none_of` would fit much better for arbitrary arity, but of course that pesky underscore is back.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/981570", "created_at": "2011-04-10T23:49:07Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/258#issuecomment-981570", "updated_at": "2011-04-10T23:49:07Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 258, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h3h/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h3h/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h3h/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/h3h", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h3h/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/h3h", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h3h/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/311c297fac1413aed55bced7735dea29?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9701a1c165dd9420816bfec5edd6c2b1.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h3h/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h3h/received_events", "gravatar_id": "311c297fac1413aed55bced7735dea29", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h3h/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "h3h", "type": "User", "id": 1401, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/h3h/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52386422bd3543c1510125a4"}, "id": 981570, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/258"}
