{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7573", "repo": "rails", "body": "@keithgabryelski hey, thanks for your work on that. I didn't review the pull request, I'll leave most of it for @tenderlove, but I see you've sent it for 3-2-stable branch.\n\nWe usually don't merge new features onto this branch, only bug fixes and backports. So I'll have to ask you to send a new pull request to master instead, because unfortunately github doesn't allow us to change the target branch. You can link to this one if required, and close it afterwards.
