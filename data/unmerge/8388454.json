I didn't review the pull request, I'll leave most of it for @tenderlove, but I see you've sent it for 3-2-stable branch.\n\nWe usually don't merge new features onto this branch, only bug fixes and backports. So I'll have to ask you to send a new pull request to master instead, because unfortunately github doesn't allow us to change the target branch. You can link to this one if required, and close it afterwards. Thanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "5237fa19bd3543c15100b593"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7573#issuecomment-8388454"}
