This is intentional and documented. The documentation says that it starts the form tag and the block version is an exception to this behavior.\r\n\r\nThis is similar with `File.open` that closes the file if you pass a block, but not close it without the block.\r\n\r\nAlso I discussed about the change in the vendor code and they said that we don't need to accept it because the change is to identify the `form_tag` possible issue.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f7cfbd3543c15100b12d"}, "issue_id": 7901, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9338215", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7901#issuecomment-9338215", "updated_at": "2012-10-11T12:38:33Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca", "login": "rafaelfranca", "gravatar_id": "0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03", "html_url": "https://github.com/rafaelfranca", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/0525b332aafb83307b32d9747a93de03?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2c7b84fa30f0cea96a90729afe2970a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 47848, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-11T12:38:33Z", "id": 9338215, "owner": "rails"}
