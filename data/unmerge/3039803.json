I like `pluck` because it's pretty damn simple. I think other complexities to deal with serialisation etc are not sufficiently common that they should be handled in Rails core. Plus, I am loathe to add another place where we have to deal with attribute stuff.\r\n\r\nI'd be up for having `pluck` take multiple arguments, though. (e.g. `Person.pluck(:name, :age) #=> [[\"Jon\", 22], ...]`)\r\n\r\nI'd be pleased to hear actual use cases rather than a chorus of \"+1\" :)", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f635"}, "issue_id": 3871, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3039803", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3039803", "updated_at": "2011-12-06T22:18:38Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "login": "jonleighton", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-12-06T22:18:38Z", "id": 3039803, "owner": "rails"}
