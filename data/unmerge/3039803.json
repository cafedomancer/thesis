I like `pluck` because it's pretty damn simple. I think other complexities to deal with serialisation etc are not sufficiently common that they should be handled in Rails core. Plus, I am loathe to add another place where we have to deal with attribute stuff.\r\n\r\nI'd be up for having `pluck` take multiple arguments, though. (e.g. `Person.pluck(:name, :age) #=> [[\"Jon\", 22], ...]`)\r\n\r\nI'd be pleased to hear actual use cases rather than a chorus of \"+1\" :)", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f635"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3039803"}
