Ignoring the RVM aspect of the initial issue post....  99% of the time your going to be adding additional gems to your gemfile (sometimes even changing rails to use edge etc) after creating a new app, which means you will have to re-bundle anyway, which means another request to rubygems.org (which even yesterday kept failing to respond for me for an hour or so :) ).\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the point of adding it to begin with was to ease the setup / get started for new users? I don't see any other purpose of it really. I haven't checked to see how it effects using an app template on a new project.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384785bd3543c1510110a0"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2170#issuecomment-1625324"}
