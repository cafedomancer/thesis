{"body": "Id agree with @josevalim that --skip-bundle would follow the existing pattern, I just think its weird since it would default to true, you'd basically set --skip-bundler false each time :)  Choosing your javascript etc uses -j (unless something changed) so I'd think --bundle makes more sense since your explicitly saying you want to do something. \r\n\r\nAn even better solution would be to remove it completely IMO, if you want to run bundler automatically create an application template. Ignoring the RVM aspect of the initial issue post....  99% of the time your going to be adding additional gems to your gemfile (sometimes even changing rails to use edge etc) after creating a new app, which means you will have to re-bundle anyway, which means another request to rubygems.org (which even yesterday kept failing to respond for me for an hour or so :) ).\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the point of adding it to begin with was to ease the setup / get started for new users? I don't see any other purpose of it really. I haven't checked to see how it effects using an app template on a new project.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1625324", "created_at": "2011-07-21T17:40:41Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2170#issuecomment-1625324", "updated_at": "2011-07-21T17:40:41Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 2170, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentkirby/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentkirby/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentkirby/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentkirby", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentkirby/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/brentkirby", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentkirby/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/3afaec649e9d3fd0ddc32044ed0148e5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe09209fa7d50dd588bcd3e68a1474729.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentkirby/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentkirby/received_events", "gravatar_id": "3afaec649e9d3fd0ddc32044ed0148e5", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentkirby/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "brentkirby", "type": "User", "id": 760352, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentkirby/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52384785bd3543c1510110a0"}, "id": 1625324, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2170"}
