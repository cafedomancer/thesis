{"body": "If the `find_by` method also should use duped attributes, you should use `temp_attrs` in both places:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  temp_attrs = attributes.dup\r\n  find_by(temp_attrs) || create(temp_attrs , &block)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if `find_by` doesn't need duped attrs, you should only dupe them for the `create` method so you don't spend cycles duping where its not needed:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  find_by(attributes) || create(attributes.dup , &block)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be great to have a test for this that ensures original attributes are no longer mutated.\r\n\r\nFinally, why is duping an issue in find_or_create type methods but not in the underlying create/new methods? Should you instead modify the new/create methods to dupe?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16248074", "created_at": "2013-04-11T17:08:47Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10181#issuecomment-16248074", "updated_at": "2013-04-11T17:10:29Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 10181, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/egilburg", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F552d65b6e9616642fd0217dc7f8361bd.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/received_events", "gravatar_id": "cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "egilburg", "type": "User", "id": 242532, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e271bd3543c151009020"}, "id": 16248074, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10181"}
