Should you instead modify the new/create methods to dupe?", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e271bd3543c151009020"}, "issue_id": 10181, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16248074", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10181#issuecomment-16248074", "updated_at": "2013-04-11T17:10:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg", "login": "egilburg", "gravatar_id": "cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6", "html_url": "https://github.com/egilburg", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4f5494a8dcaaf577e678cb3901dab6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F552d65b6e9616642fd0217dc7f8361bd.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 242532, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/egilburg/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-04-11T17:08:47Z", "id": 16248074, "owner": "rails"}
