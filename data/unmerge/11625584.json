A class that includes `ActiveModel::Model`  will also [include](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/48b40ec6faeb6cd4cf2ec0a6df4fa1fe2ee21806/activemodel/lib/active_model/model.rb#L63) `ActiveModel::Validations` and [extend](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/48b40ec6faeb6cd4cf2ec0a6df4fa1fe2ee21806/activemodel/lib/active_model/validations.rb#L42) `ActiveModel::Callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThe reason I opened this issue is that I was using `ActiveModel::Model` and I had a moment of confusion because callbacks were working, validations were working, but a call to `before_validation` was giving me a `NoMethodError`. A brief hunt through the Rails code revealed that I needed to include `ActiveModel::Validations::Callbacks` separately.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I totally respect @rafaelfranca's choice to keep `ActiveModel::Model` minimal.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f1f6bd3543c15100a529"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8580#issuecomment-11625584"}
