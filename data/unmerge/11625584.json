A class that includes `ActiveModel::Model`  will also [include](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/48b40ec6faeb6cd4cf2ec0a6df4fa1fe2ee21806/activemodel/lib/active_model/model.rb#L63) `ActiveModel::Validations` and [extend](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/48b40ec6faeb6cd4cf2ec0a6df4fa1fe2ee21806/activemodel/lib/active_model/validations.rb#L42) `ActiveModel::Callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThe reason I opened this issue is that I was using `ActiveModel::Model` and I had a moment of confusion because callbacks were working, validations were working, but a call to `before_validation` was giving me a `NoMethodError`. A brief hunt through the Rails code revealed that I needed to include `ActiveModel::Validations::Callbacks` separately.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I totally respect @rafaelfranca's choice to keep `ActiveModel::Model` minimal.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f1f6bd3543c15100a529"}, "issue_id": 8580, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11625584", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8580#issuecomment-11625584", "updated_at": "2012-12-21T20:11:33Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balexand/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balexand/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balexand/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balexand/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/balexand", "login": "balexand", "gravatar_id": "6180d7335815945eda8651e080be4b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/balexand", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balexand/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balexand/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balexand/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/6180d7335815945eda8651e080be4b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F719e4a634d354ee009ee1b9b148b8eef.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balexand/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 181187, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/balexand/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-21T20:11:33Z", "id": 11625584, "owner": "rails"}
