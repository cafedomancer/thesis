{"body": "@drogus It's very common to set whatever configuration stuff you need in an initializer (Thinks resque/airbrake/simpleform) etc. I'd like to make the generator show that it is very easy to make `Rails.application.config.#{gem_name}` work and it's not just black magic. @carlosantoniodasilva was right that not all engines will require configuration, which is why it makes more sense to put it in a comment showing you _how_ you could do that. For that matter, I think it's better to show the end user how to configure different parts of the engines with commented out examples.
