{"body": "I'm a little late to the discussion, but @bcardarella asked me on twitter to stop by so I figured I'd try to add something.\n\nI agree with @dhh that we should hold off adding a `:cost` option until it's needed. That may seem like this conflicts with what I said in the Authlogic bcrypt comment, but I don't think it does.\n\nFor the common case people are better off using the default cost, assuming it's a good default, which I believe 10 is (for now).\n\nFor the person who wants control and knows enough about how bcrypt works, there is still the `BCrypt::Engine::DEFAULT_COST` constant. I have adjusted it in the past, but tbh I'm probably more likely to decrease it so the specs run fast. I would probably only increment the cost if the default in bcrypt-ruby doesn't keep pace. The work to hash the password doubles for every increment, so it's fine as long as the default cost increments every 2 years.\n\nFrom an API design pov, I like the idea of putting a tiny barrier in place to setting the cost. It makes it more like that if someone does change the default they'll be doing it out of necessity and because they understand the trade-offs. Making it a bit \"ugly\" compared to other parts of the API underscores that it's something you should only set if you know what you're doing.\n\nSince there is still discussion on this I think we're better off leaving the option out and waiting for some real-world cases to arise that forces the API to change. It's really easy to add options to an API, but really hard to remove them later.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1025067", "created_at": "2011-04-19T04:44:36Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/285#issuecomment-1025067", "updated_at": "2011-04-19T04:46:00Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 285, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/dkubb", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7c92608db4acf7a44337670eff6ce5bc?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9fc3d7152ba9336a670e36d0ed79bc43.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7c92608db4acf7a44337670eff6ce5bc", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "dkubb", "type": "User", "id": 133, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238635abd3543c1510124be"}, "id": 1025067, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/285"}
