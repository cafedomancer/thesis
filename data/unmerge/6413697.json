{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3989", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks for your patch, although I have to say that the usage seems a bit confusing to me, specially with lambdas:\n\n```ruby\nassert_difference( { lambda{@object.num} => 0, lambda{@object.num + 1} => 0 } ) do\n  @object.decrement\n  @object.increment\nend\n```\n\nAnother thing that makes me think twice is the possibility of giving one `message` to any number of difference expectations:\n\n```ruby\nassert_difference( { '@object.num' => -1,\n                     '@object.num + 1' => -1,\n                     :message => \"Foo! Expected @object to decrease by one\" } ) do\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\nI'm happy with nested `assert_difference` when necessary, even with RSpec where you can do `expect {}.to change`, nesting looks ok. Well, just my 2 cents.\n\n@josevalim @rafaelfranca thoughts?", "_id": {"$oid": "52382e79bd3543c15100f379"}, "issue_id": 3989, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6413697", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3989#issuecomment-6413697", "updated_at": "2012-06-19T01:14:40Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva", "login": "carlosantoniodasilva", "gravatar_id": "77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837", "html_url": "https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/77237b97a465ae5a293ad323b7296837?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F60b997fd68261ce70cadaf6c8226c042.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 26328, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-19T01:14:40Z", "id": 6413697, "owner": "rails"}
