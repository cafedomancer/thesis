Expected @object to decrease by one\" } ) do\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\nI'm happy with nested `assert_difference` when necessary, even with RSpec where you can do `expect {}.to change`, nesting looks ok. Well, just my 2 cents.\n\n@josevalim @rafaelfranca thoughts?", "_id": {"$oid": "52382e79bd3543c15100f379"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3989#issuecomment-6413697"}
