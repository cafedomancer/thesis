With sidekiq and celluloid becoming more popular and even with Rails 4 threaded queue, this will become more and more common. That said, I am fine with having a connection pool and having a default size > 1 (the actual value should go in another discussion).\n\nThe way I see the connection pool (and concurrency in general) is as any other Rails feature, it is better to be on by default, so the ecosystem can build software based on this assumption. The cost and conceptual arguments you present are the same as any other Rails feature (for example, one could argue to turn off many features by default to reduce eventual conceptual and performance cost).", "_id": {"$oid": "52380552bd3543c15100c70b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6685#issuecomment-6271178"}
