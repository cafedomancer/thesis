{"body": "We use this pattern a handful of times in our application for unique, optional names.  In SQL NULL values are exempt from unique index enforcement, but empty strings are not.  So NULL/nil is the appropriate \"unset\" value.  We use validates_presence_of ... :allow_nil => true so that Rails catches anyone trying to set the name to an empty or blank string.\r\n\r\nBut even without that example, I think the change makes sense because it achieves an orthogonal interface that follows the Principle of Least Surprise.  Simply the benefit of removing an unnecessary special case from the Guide would convince me!  (I argue that it was unnecessary because ignoring these options in the case of this one validator did not benefit anyone.)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11697781", "created_at": "2012-12-27T00:44:23Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8622#issuecomment-11697781", "updated_at": "2012-12-27T00:44:23Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 8622, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/ColinDKelley", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/0a38a3f16001fa9c426c90ffd94e03d0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fccbc7407a51bbac276e820ad5d73552b.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/received_events", "gravatar_id": "0a38a3f16001fa9c426c90ffd94e03d0", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "ColinDKelley", "type": "User", "id": 166511, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ColinDKelley/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f18fbd3543c15100a477"}, "id": 11697781, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8622"}
