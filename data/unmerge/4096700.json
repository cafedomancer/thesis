{"body": "@bcardarella that's the use case that I take issue with. Here we have two 'invitable/invitation' in the load path. One is the \"app\" model, a specialization of the engine model. We want autoload to load the app model first, yet still be able to load the underlying engine model.\r\n\r\nComing up with a way around the load path is one answer here. But - now you have two problems.\r\n\r\nSome other ways to do this:\r\n1. Mix behavior in to engine modules using an initializer that requires your extensions, probably from lib/\r\n2. Subclass engine models in your app and use these instead.\r\n3. Start with app models, always, and rely on engines for behavior mix-ins instead of fully-baked classes.\r\n\r\nIn the `Invitable::Invitation` case you cite, it feels like #3 would be a good candidate: keep `Invitation` in your app and mix in the `Invitable` concern. Then customize your app's model as you like.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4096700", "created_at": "2012-02-22T02:30:32Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5120#issuecomment-4096700", "updated_at": "2012-02-22T02:30:32Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5120, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jeremy", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84d9ee44e457ddef7f2c4f25dc8fa865.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/received_events", "gravatar_id": "24d2f8804e6bb4b7ea6bd11e0a586470", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jeremy", "type": "User", "id": 199, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jeremy/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c95bd3543c15100e4f7"}, "id": 4096700, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5120"}
