Here we have two 'invitable/invitation' in the load path. One is the \"app\" model, a specialization of the engine model. We want autoload to load the app model first, yet still be able to load the underlying engine model.\r\n\r\nComing up with a way around the load path is one answer here. But - now you have two problems.\r\n\r\nSome other ways to do this:\r\n1. Mix behavior in to engine modules using an initializer that requires your extensions, probably from lib/\r\n2. Subclass engine models in your app and use these instead.\r\n3. Start with app models, always, and rely on engines for behavior mix-ins instead of fully-baked classes.\r\n\r\nIn the `Invitable::Invitation` case you cite, it feels like #3 would be a good candidate: keep `Invitation` in your app and mix in the `Invitable` concern. Then customize your app's model as you like.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381c95bd3543c15100e4f7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5120#issuecomment-4096700"}
