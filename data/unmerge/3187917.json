Users of your API can certainly read that documentation and understand it.\r\n\r\nIf you allow idempotent partial updates via PUT requests also that's your business. Users of your API can read that documentation and understand it.\r\n\r\nBut If you are a Rails programmer and want to provide DELETE for deletion and PUT for full updates the framework provides the means[*]. As of today there's no builtin way to do partial updates, because there's no builtin way in HTTP. This thread is about whether Rails as a framework should do something about this, not about the practical urgency you may feel. People have done delete via POST for ages.\r\n\r\n[*] The current idioms with update_attributes are perfectly fine for full representations via PUT. \"Full representation\" belongs to your interface, update_attributes is your implementation. If your API requires a full representation (except perhaps for some internal stuff like cache counts), update_attributes allows you to store one just fine.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012147"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3187917"}
