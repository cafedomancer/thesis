{"body": "The FormBuilder already supports many HTML5 inputs and is also already doing i18n lookups for labels (and looking at many different keys in that case - see #3671). I'm willing to alter the patch to only do the translation when placeholder is set to the boolean value true, if that's what it takes.\r\n\r\nLong term, though, does it make sense to add options to the form builder itself that would control whether lookups are done for the different strings involved in inputs and labels? For instance: `form_for @object, :translate_labels => true, :translate_placeholders => true`\r\n\r\nLabels could be set to true by default for backward compatibility.
