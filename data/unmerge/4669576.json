The issue is not in the Ruby code which I believe is doing the correct thing. Duck typing is awesome because we don't have to force things to be `true` or `false`. If this breaks your JS, well then you need to write a smarter converter. Trying to force Ruby to be compatible with other languages sets a very bad precedent.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e20f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4669576"}
