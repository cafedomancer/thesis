{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5329", "repo": "rails", "body": "I think the crux of this problem is the example is trying to coerce Ruby's idea of truthiness to Javascript's idea of truthiness and they are far from aligned. The issue is not in the Ruby code which I believe is doing the correct thing. Duck typing is awesome because we don't have to force things to be `true` or `false`. If this breaks your JS, well then you need to write a smarter converter. Trying to force Ruby to be compatible with other languages sets a very bad precedent.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e20f"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4669576", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4669576", "updated_at": "2012-03-23T23:04:48Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bionicpill/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bionicpill/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bionicpill/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bionicpill/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bionicpill", "login": "bionicpill", "gravatar_id": "a847218db9ff6947766b57797f65e45a", "html_url": "https://github.com/bionicpill", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bionicpill/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bionicpill/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bionicpill/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a847218db9ff6947766b57797f65e45a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F5594516f8a2fdcc09e6802fbae8d7e9e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bionicpill/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 240441, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bionicpill/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-23T23:04:48Z", "id": 4669576, "owner": "rails"}
