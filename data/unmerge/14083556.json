What's the benefit of an API token over this? \r\n\r\nAlso, you say sessions for an API are \"horribly wrong\", but _why_? Why do we need to be treating non-browser clients differently to browsers? They're both just clients between the user and the site.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ea3ebd3543c151009983"}, "issue_id": 9405, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14083556", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9405#issuecomment-14083556", "updated_at": "2013-02-25T23:37:49Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dan2552/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dan2552/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dan2552/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dan2552/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dan2552", "login": "Dan2552", "gravatar_id": "51f5b50028b4d67725f4ad18170a5066", "html_url": "https://github.com/Dan2552", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dan2552/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dan2552/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dan2552/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/51f5b50028b4d67725f4ad18170a5066?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F2945baa5c102a460bd804b69dc01e591.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dan2552/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1478221, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Dan2552/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-25T23:37:21Z", "id": 14083556, "owner": "rails"}
