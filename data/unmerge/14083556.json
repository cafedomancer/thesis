What's the benefit of an API token over this? \r\n\r\nAlso, you say sessions for an API are \"horribly wrong\", but _why_? Why do we need to be treating non-browser clients differently to browsers? They're both just clients between the user and the site.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ea3ebd3543c151009983"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9405#issuecomment-14083556"}
