{"body": "I don't consider this to be a bug.\r\n\r\n`physician.patients` is an association proxy. `physician.patients.where(name: 'neeraj')` is a relation. I don't think we can reliably support association mutation in the case of relations built off association proxies. Consider that you could change the association in any way, including e.g. `physician.patients.joins(\"...\")` or even `physician.patients.only(...)`, etc.\r\n\r\nSo even though this makes sense in this specific case, I think it's a dangerous road to go down to try to support this.\r\n\r\nIn this case it would be better to use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nphysician.patients.find_or_create_by(name: 'neeraj')\r\n```", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17383909", "created_at": "2013-05-03T08:40:53Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10367#issuecomment-17383909", "updated_at": "2013-05-03T08:40:53Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 10367, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jonleighton", "type": "User", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523cd73dbd354364b9003043"}, "id": 17383909, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10367"}
