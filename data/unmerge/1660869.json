This is due to a missing dependency issue: the database database_gemfile_entry is only included for full or mountable plugins, and yet it's required to run tests regardless. On a related note, the database gem should probably be a development, not a base, dependency by default.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if these minor issues make my pull request worthwhile for 3-1-stable. However, I've had a lot of trouble determining best practices for using \"rails plugin new\", and I think these changes would help get developers off to a good start with this new feature.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384549bd3543c151010df9"}, "issue_id": 2282, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1660869", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2282#issuecomment-1660869", "updated_at": "2011-07-27T02:58:07Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dgeb/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dgeb/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dgeb/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dgeb/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dgeb", "login": "dgeb", "gravatar_id": "e01ec1de2f7783812d2235a6a9aaaeea", "html_url": "https://github.com/dgeb", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dgeb/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dgeb/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dgeb/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e01ec1de2f7783812d2235a6a9aaaeea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F837e868ffbb3a67451e480e1864e071d.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dgeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 29122, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dgeb/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-07-27T02:58:07Z", "id": 1660869, "owner": "rails"}
