This is due to a missing dependency issue: the database database_gemfile_entry is only included for full or mountable plugins, and yet it's required to run tests regardless. On a related note, the database gem should probably be a development, not a base, dependency by default.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if these minor issues make my pull request worthwhile for 3-1-stable. However, I've had a lot of trouble determining best practices for using \"rails plugin new\", and I think these changes would help get developers off to a good start with this new feature.", "_id": {"$oid": "52384549bd3543c151010df9"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2282#issuecomment-1660869"}
