But we also have to think that by applying once big change like that, we'd get tons of other big changes to make things consistent *everywhere*, and we can avoid that by not applying cosmetic/general changes. It's better to do it in baby steps.\r\n\r\nBesides that, @rafaelfranca just linked me to a related pull request/comment that I missed, please take a look #7781. \r\n\r\nThanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "523d94ccbd354364b90080c8"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8367#issuecomment-10845683"}
