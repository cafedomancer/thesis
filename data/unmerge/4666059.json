(i.e. Array#empty?).\r\n\r\nNo rubyist would *ever* write `unless request.xhr? == true` and the part of our app that broke had some parameterization passed similar to `:ajax_request => request.xhr?`, which TBH isn't great style, but would break down when testing for `true` or `false` in a language such as javascript where `0` evaluates to `false`.\r\n\r\nAnd regardless of Ruby style opinions (obviously I'm in the camp that thinks it's bad style to not return `true` or `false` from a `#method?`) it's an API change coming from 2.3. In 2.3 it returned `true` or `false`. API changes that happen without good reason are only going to frustrate your users.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e1fa"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4666059"}
