(i.e. Array#empty?).\r\n\r\nNo rubyist would *ever* write `unless request.xhr? == true` and the part of our app that broke had some parameterization passed similar to `:ajax_request => request.xhr?`, which TBH isn't great style, but would break down when testing for `true` or `false` in a language such as javascript where `0` evaluates to `false`.\r\n\r\nAnd regardless of Ruby style opinions (obviously I'm in the camp that thinks it's bad style to not return `true` or `false` from a `#method?`) it's an API change coming from 2.3. In 2.3 it returned `true` or `false`. API changes that happen without good reason are only going to frustrate your users.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e1fa"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4666059", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4666059", "updated_at": "2012-03-23T19:17:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton", "login": "clifton", "gravatar_id": "4cede21ea96795d2de831e9981cc81cd", "html_url": "https://github.com/clifton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4cede21ea96795d2de831e9981cc81cd?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc27181a18d3b30d14d66a1a56c068548.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 14217, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/clifton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-23T19:16:19Z", "id": 4666059, "owner": "rails"}
