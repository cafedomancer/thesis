{"body": "Well, to be fair, github.com/styleguide from @kneath\r\n\r\n> The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value) should end in a question mark. (i.e. Array#empty?).\r\n\r\nNo rubyist would *ever* write `unless request.xhr? == true` and the part of our app that broke had some parameterization passed similar to `:ajax_request => request.xhr?`, which TBH isn't great style, but would break down when testing for `true` or `false` in a language such as javascript where `0` evaluates to `false`.\r\n\r\nAnd regardless of Ruby style opinions (obviously I'm in the camp that thinks it's bad style to not return `true` or `false` from a `#method?`) it's an API change coming from 2.3. In 2.3 it returned `true` or `false`.
