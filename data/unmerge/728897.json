I'll send another pull request pronto :) ", "_id": {"$oid": "52386669bd3543c1510127d6"}, "issue_id": 178, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/728897", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/178#issuecomment-728897", "updated_at": "2011-02-01T15:48:40Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saimonmoore/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saimonmoore/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saimonmoore/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saimonmoore/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/saimonmoore", "login": "saimonmoore", "gravatar_id": "982c3f128bb78678033c0bf8c0e226bc", "html_url": "https://github.com/saimonmoore", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saimonmoore/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saimonmoore/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saimonmoore/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/982c3f128bb78678033c0bf8c0e226bc?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F1be3bc32e6564055d5ca3e5a354acbef.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saimonmoore/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 494, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/saimonmoore/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-02-01T15:48:40Z", "id": 728897, "owner": "rails"}
