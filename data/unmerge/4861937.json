RLY?!\r\n\r\nBe reasonable, there are simple use cases where this is desired for a site where simple password authentication is necessary (which has_secure_password is *perfect* for).  Example: a site where invitations are sent by user X to user Y and user Y confirms by filling out a password/password confirmation.  The invited user should persist without without a valid password until user Y clicks a link in an email and completes registration.\r\n\r\nA not-so-terrible workaround is to manually validate the minimum required data, manually populate the errors and, if all goes well, save without validations.  :allow_nil, please.  kthx!", "_id": {"$oid": "52383026bd3543c15100f5f5"}, "issue_id": 3887, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4861937", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3887#issuecomment-4861937", "updated_at": "2012-04-02T10:40:53Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fermion/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fermion/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fermion/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fermion/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fermion", "login": "fermion", "gravatar_id": "725d78780e24d930b9f3a910a10f71cb", "html_url": "https://github.com/fermion", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fermion/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fermion/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fermion/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/725d78780e24d930b9f3a910a10f71cb?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4ab52371762b735317125e6446a51e8f.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fermion/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2804, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fermion/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-31T21:38:29Z", "id": 4861937, "owner": "rails"}
