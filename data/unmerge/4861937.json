RLY?!\r\n\r\nBe reasonable, there are simple use cases where this is desired for a site where simple password authentication is necessary (which has_secure_password is *perfect* for).  Example: a site where invitations are sent by user X to user Y and user Y confirms by filling out a password/password confirmation.  The invited user should persist without without a valid password until user Y clicks a link in an email and completes registration.\r\n\r\nA not-so-terrible workaround is to manually validate the minimum required data, manually populate the errors and, if all goes well, save without validations.  :allow_nil, please.  kthx!", "_id": {"$oid": "52383026bd3543c15100f5f5"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3887#issuecomment-4861937"}
