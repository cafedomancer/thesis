I think the \"is this a reusable instance?\" confusion is important, but it's not all consuming. I'm certainly willing to entertain another try.\r\n\r\nI actually wanted to make this work because I liked how the example code looked, but then I applied the approach to a bunch of controllers I had and the after code was worse than the before code in every case. I'd be happy to give that another try if you guys come up with a break through.\r\n\r\nOn Dec 24, 2012, at 9:43 AM, Yehuda Katz <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> @dhh Thanks for your feedback.
