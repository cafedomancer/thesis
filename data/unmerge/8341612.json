{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2076", "repo": "rails", "body": "@NZKoz Hi, @jimweirich has fixed this issue in builder 3.1.0. Alas, 3-1-stable, 3-2-stable and master are all locked down to builder ~> 3.0.0. I've asked Jim if he can release a patch version so rails users can use the change, but it seems that rails shouldn't be locked down to ~> 3.0.0 if we're depending on builder to fix the issue.
