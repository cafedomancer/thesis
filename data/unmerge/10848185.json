That was a theoretical \"sometime in the future\" type of thing, and I was not planning on changing the generator, so the 2nd cost is invalid as well. So in the end the benefit is clearer more concise definition over very small chance of obscure loading bugs that are only caused if people actually use `:class` in the association.\r\n\r\n@rafaelfranca I agree that a cosmetic change is not worth the chance of more bugs, but would hammer the point that this is not just an association definition problem. The load issues described could affect any class method called in the body of a model that references another model (or perhaps autoloaded non-model classes and models or non-models with non-models). That is a different issue however, and wouldn't need to be addressed in this pull request.\r\n\r\nThanks for everyone's input and consideration, and sorry to waste time on this.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f3e9bd3543c15100a92f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8357#issuecomment-10848185"}
