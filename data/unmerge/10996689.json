That's problematic if you have multiple servers with significantly different processing power, and may also depend on what else is currently running on each server at the same time. It can't answer the question \"how long should it take to check a password?\" - it can only answer the question \"how long should it take to check a password on the current server with this given processing power, at this moment in time with this given server load?\"\r\n\r\nIt's OK to publicize the right cost for most applications just like we publicize the right key lengths for most SSL certificates. It's even possible to `rails g` a blank user class with `has_secure_password` and, above it, a comment about cost.", "_id": {"$oid": "523d9148bd354364b9007df7"}, "issue_id": 8408, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10996689", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8408#issuecomment-10996689", "updated_at": "2012-12-04T13:38:42Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum", "login": "yfeldblum", "gravatar_id": "5eadf00e11240f05263ec7735612cd09", "html_url": "https://github.com/yfeldblum", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/5eadf00e11240f05263ec7735612cd09?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F485970c473e9165d1649e16c7aa35b83.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 169419, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-04T13:38:42Z", "id": 10996689, "owner": "rails"}
