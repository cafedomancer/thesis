{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5836", "repo": "rails", "body": "Just out of curiosity (as I am aware of Array#drop), by this argument, why bother with a `.first` convenience method or the others that rails provides (`.second`, `.third`, etc.) instead of array[0], array[1], array[2], etc.? To be closer to English is my guess, but the `rest` verbage seems closer to the concept than `drop(1)`. Just to get an idea.
