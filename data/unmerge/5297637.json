{"body": "@bcardarella I'm definitely looking at Squeel for inspiration on the DM 2.0 API. I'm looking at quite a few places within the Ruby community, and outside like in SQL Alchemy (python). Nothing is 100% finalized at this point since we're still designing the public facing APIs.\r\n\r\nI don't want to hijack this thread, since this is the rails tracker, but the current plan for DM2 is to push query improvements down to the veritas layer and expose those to the end user. When we're further along I would love to get input from you and @ernie if you're interested.\r\n\r\nAs far as the Symbol extensions we are moving away from those as something we do automatically. What DM1 does by monkey patching the Symbol classes is not really being a good ruby citizen IMHO, but since it's part of the API from the beginning I couldn't exactly remove it. At most, if Symbol extensions are supported in DM2, they would be optional -- a user would have to explicitly require something to have them added, and/or use a separate gem.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the Symbol extensions have caused conflicts with other libraries that do the same thing, like for example MongoMapper.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5297637", "created_at": "2012-04-24T05:06:26Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5948#issuecomment-5297637", "updated_at": "2012-04-24T05:06:26Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5948, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/dkubb", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7c92608db4acf7a44337670eff6ce5bc?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9fc3d7152ba9336a670e36d0ed79bc43.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7c92608db4acf7a44337670eff6ce5bc", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "dkubb", "type": "User", "id": 133, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dkubb/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52381101bd3543c15100d746"}, "id": 5297637, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5948"}
