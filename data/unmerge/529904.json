Sure, you can stuff those into the 'message' parameter, but then you're typing \"Model should be valid: #{@model.errors.full_messages.join('\\n')}\" every time you try to assert the validity of a model, which you'll eventually DRY into a custom assertion method.\r\n\r\nNot that I'd necessarily want Rails to provide it, but I can see why this particular custom assertion would be useful.", "_id": {"$oid": "52386a6ebd3543c151012b39"}, "issue_id": 95, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/529904", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/95#issuecomment-529904", "updated_at": "2010-11-09T20:20:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/justinweiss/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/justinweiss/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/justinweiss/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/justinweiss/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/justinweiss", "login": "justinweiss", "gravatar_id": "81cb8ff8ba584785c33bc786997624bc", "html_url": "https://github.com/justinweiss", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/justinweiss/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/justinweiss/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/justinweiss/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/81cb8ff8ba584785c33bc786997624bc?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F65cc2c8205a05d7379fa3a6386f710e1.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/justinweiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1020, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/justinweiss/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2010-11-09T20:20:32Z", "id": 529904, "owner": "rails"}
