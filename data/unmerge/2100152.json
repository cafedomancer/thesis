{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/2886", "repo": "rails", "body": "@spastorino ya know, thinking about this some more...one of the benefits of precompiling assets is to generate static files that the web server can serve, without involving rails or any middleware.  So the middleware solution doesn't really support that.  Seems like what we need is a way to say that certain assets should be copied (probably duplicated) without a digest.\r\n\r\nThis could be taken care of in deployment- right after assets:precompile could be a task to copy some assets...but that just kind of feels kludgy. Seems like the assets:precompile could do the right thing, if we had a way to specify what that right thing was...\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52383e0abd3543c15101053c"}, "issue_id": 2886, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2100152", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/2886#issuecomment-2100152", "updated_at": "2011-09-15T01:36:33Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker", "login": "greinacker", "gravatar_id": "1f4455584c55f3c9cfd2d485439603e5", "html_url": "https://github.com/greinacker", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/1f4455584c55f3c9cfd2d485439603e5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fdd6cd99f4184e944b6afef445f496c04.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 759955, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/greinacker/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-09-15T01:36:33Z", "id": 2100152, "owner": "rails"}
