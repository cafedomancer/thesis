Remember that JSON apis aren't just used by javascript running in html pages.\n\njQuery has .text() and .html() which will escape or not,  hogan.js has {{ vs {{{.  What you're describing is a bug with client side code, and not something that we can fix.  It'd be like making every sql database return xml escaped strings, sure it'd fix some problems but it'd break so much more.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380bbbbd3543c15100d05a"}, "issue_id": 6288, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5674699", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6288#issuecomment-5674699", "updated_at": "2012-05-13T08:04:14Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-13T08:04:14Z", "id": 5674699, "owner": "rails"}
