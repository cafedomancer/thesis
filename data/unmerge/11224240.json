He intends that each record will hold its transaction in an ivar, rather than the other way round. Then, calling e.g. `record.new_record?` will query the transaction state. It will still be necessary to hold a list of records in the transaction for records with commit/rollback hooks, that's unavoidable. But for the usual case it should work.\r\n\r\nAre you up for implementing that?", "_id": {"$oid": "52383866bd3543c15100ffe7"}, "issue_id": 3300, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11224240", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3300#issuecomment-11224240", "updated_at": "2012-12-10T23:40:41Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "login": "jonleighton", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-10T23:40:41Z", "id": 11224240, "owner": "rails"}
