He intends that each record will hold its transaction in an ivar, rather than the other way round. Then, calling e.g. `record.new_record?` will query the transaction state. It will still be necessary to hold a list of records in the transaction for records with commit/rollback hooks, that's unavoidable. But for the usual case it should work.\r\n\r\nAre you up for implementing that?", "_id": {"$oid": "52383866bd3543c15100ffe7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3300#issuecomment-11224240"}
