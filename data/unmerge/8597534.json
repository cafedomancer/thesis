{"body": "For me stats were always only for giving some rough info, can we just assume that it's just a feature to see how the project is doing, but not something that will show exact information on all of the statistics?\n\nI would vote to close this pull request (I remember also a few other requests related to stats if there are still any open ones). I would only merge something that extends this task to allow to add your own logic for getting stats (although it would need to be something simple, for example ability to say that stats should use some other class, so you could implement your own functionality).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8597534", "created_at": "2012-09-16T18:40:26Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5890#issuecomment-8597534", "updated_at": "2012-09-16T21:38:29Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5890, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/drogus", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3202111cf90e7c816a472aaceb72b0df.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/received_events", "gravatar_id": "582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "drogus", "type": "User", "id": 5004, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52381195bd3543c15100d837"}, "id": 8597534, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5890"}
