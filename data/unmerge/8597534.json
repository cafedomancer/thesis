I would only merge something that extends this task to allow to add your own logic for getting stats (although it would need to be something simple, for example ability to say that stats should use some other class, so you could implement your own functionality).", "_id": {"$oid": "52381195bd3543c15100d837"}, "issue_id": 5890, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/8597534", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5890#issuecomment-8597534", "updated_at": "2012-09-16T21:38:29Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus", "login": "drogus", "gravatar_id": "582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30", "html_url": "https://github.com/drogus", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3202111cf90e7c816a472aaceb72b0df.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5004, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-09-16T18:40:26Z", "id": 8597534, "owner": "rails"}
