As far as I understand the 4K limit, the escaped value should not exceed the 4K, but I check the raw value. Also, it's allowed to store an Array in the cookie. In that case, I don't calculate the correct value length either. What do you think, should I adjust the behavior to reflect this or isn't it worth the hassle? Maybe Rack should check the length of cookies, not Rails.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380416bd3543c15100c536"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6796#issuecomment-6458379"}
