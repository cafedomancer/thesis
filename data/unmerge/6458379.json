{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6796", "repo": "rails", "body": "Well, after thinking about this, I believe my implementation is not correct. As far as I understand the 4K limit, the escaped value should not exceed the 4K, but I check the raw value. Also, it's allowed to store an Array in the cookie. In that case, I don't calculate the correct value length either. What do you think, should I adjust the behavior to reflect this or isn't it worth the hassle? Maybe Rack should check the length of cookies, not Rails.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380416bd3543c15100c536"}, "issue_id": 6796, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6458379", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6796#issuecomment-6458379", "updated_at": "2012-06-20T15:43:59Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iGEL/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iGEL/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iGEL/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iGEL/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/iGEL", "login": "iGEL", "gravatar_id": "ebecfa2fcf3adda56063f996b79ca6b6", "html_url": "https://github.com/iGEL", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iGEL/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iGEL/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iGEL/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ebecfa2fcf3adda56063f996b79ca6b6?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0826d4278e95e1e8090df51febb27670.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iGEL/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 36442, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iGEL/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-20T15:43:59Z", "id": 6458379, "owner": "rails"}
