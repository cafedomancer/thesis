{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3290", "repo": "rails", "body": "With current implementation where `allow_nil` and not `allow_nil` implementations are separated I am not sure I can show better memory usage benchmark because the amount of generated code reduced.\r\n\r\nAll that I wanted to do is move implementation from generated code to reused code and keep it like this no matter how behavior gonna change in future. Because it seems right to do code eval like this. Always. \r\nAs I said before: people that meet performance problems with `delegate` will get rid of it easily. \r\n\r\nAnyway I don't have any undoubted reason why this is better. So you can just close this PR.", "_id": {"$oid": "52383883bd3543c151010017"}, "issue_id": 3290, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2427054", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3290#issuecomment-2427054", "updated_at": "2011-10-17T10:12:18Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan", "login": "bogdan", "gravatar_id": "91913f6ab8085bab0f2aa43995ba8ca2", "html_url": "https://github.com/bogdan", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/91913f6ab8085bab0f2aa43995ba8ca2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F926d19e70f74c20f796d376aafa3c6e2.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 122436, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bogdan/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-10-17T10:12:18Z", "id": 2427054, "owner": "rails"}
