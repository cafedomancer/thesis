What happens (I think) is that a ConditionVariable *does* guarantee that the longest waiting thread is the first *to wake up*.  But the first thing a thread does after being woken up is re-acquire the monitor.  It's this second action that is a free-for-all.  So, yes, thread1 and thread2 will get the connection ahead of thread3 in your example, because thread3 will not be woken up.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380786bd3543c15100cae1"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6488#issuecomment-5934293"}
