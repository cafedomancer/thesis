Absent? sounds like a partner to present?, unfortunately.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf there's a -1 all around option, then I retract my +1 for apart.\r\n\r\nThis discussion is like TDD for syntax, and I think the tests are telling us something.\r\n\r\nin? Feels pretty natural, and is handy in the same way blank? and present? are. All of the rest just feel wrong.\r\n\r\nI think this is because we're trying to solve a nonexistent problem. Someone mentioned earlier how the English language doesn't really have clear one-word negation options here. That's because in English, we would say \"3 is not in the set of 1, 2, 4\". \r\n\r\nI think this tells us something, given that only real use for this method is in conditionals, to begin with (including the ternary operator). The rest aren't needed.\r\n\r\nWhere we ask \"if object.in?(array)\", the opposite is \"unless object.in?(array)\". If necessary, !object.in?(array) feels pretty natural as well. \r\n\r\nThis seems obvious, as we discuss this. blank? was handy given ruby's definition of truthiness, but present? was a welcome addition because negating a \"negative\" (!blank?) method like blank was often less expressive of intent. You don't ask \"is that space still blank?\" as often as you ask \"has it been filled in?\"\r\n\r\nSince the English idiom here is to say \"not in\", I think the standard Ruby idioms for negating the condition already complement in? nicely.", "_id": {"$oid": "52386423bd3543c1510125d2"}, "issue_id": 258, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/988807", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/258#issuecomment-988807", "updated_at": "2011-04-12T10:55:56Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie", "login": "ernie", "gravatar_id": "2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542", "html_url": "https://github.com/ernie", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6a600c968f4e6a843dcaf600c1694e42.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 14947, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-12T10:55:56Z", "id": 988807, "owner": "rails"}
