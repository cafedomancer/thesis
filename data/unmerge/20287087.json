It seems like a no-brainer security upgrade and it would be nice to avoid introducing another jar if possible. \r\n\r\nIf we only trigger the verification when there's an expires key, wouldn't that be enough? \r\n\r\nFor signed and encrypted cookies, a user wouldn't be able to manually strip an expires key, so if we encounter a cookie without an expires key, we could\u00a0just assume that was a \"legacy\" cookie and should be accepted. \r\n\r\nIf someone wanted to forcibly expire all of their legacy cookies, they could choose to change their secret key.
