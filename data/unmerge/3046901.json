It's\r\nuseful at the model layer, as well.\r\n\r\nThat's like saying that the `cycle` view helper doesn't belong in\r\nrails because admin pages use it sometimes.\r\n\r\nOn Dec 7, 2011, at 7:50 AM, Bogdan Gusiev\r\n<reply@reply.github.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Don't think that large administrative pages is under Rails core scope.\r\n>\r\n> ---\r\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\r\n> https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3046736", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3046901", "created_at": "2011-12-07T13:08:15Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3871#issuecomment-3046901", "updated_at": "2011-12-07T13:26:01Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3871, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/ernie", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6a600c968f4e6a843dcaf600c1694e42.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2274a7476f6d2ac7aedcdec0651d0542", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "ernie", "type": "User", "id": 14947, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ernie/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52383067bd3543c15100f640"}, "id": 3046901, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3871"}
