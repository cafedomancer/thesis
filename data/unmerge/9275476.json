Even if I was to write such a middleware it would be very very similar to the Show Exceptions middleware. If we wanted it to handle multiple fallbacks, that middleware would need a loop as well. Adding an extra piece of middleware wouldn't decrease complexity, or necessarily make ownership clearer it would just be moving existing code around. \r\n\r\nIdeally anyone already using dynamic error pages outlined here http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2012/01/my-five-favorite-hidden-features-in-rails-3-2/ like :\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfig.exceptions_app = self.routes\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould be able to take advantage of this fallback behavior without having to change their interface, without having to specify an additional middleware app.\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "523dc8d5bd354364b9009f4f"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7804#issuecomment-9275476"}
