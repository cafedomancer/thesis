It was never _my_ position that these changes are too premature given the status of the RFCs. The only reason I even mentioned the status of the RFCs was because they were being used in this thread, and the other threads mentioned, for various reasons, including trying to define the problem and _justifying the changes_, but without __any__ mention of the fact that all of the RFCs mentioned were in various stages of maturity, and none of them were even final standards yet. \r\n\r\nOther than that, I couldn't care less. I agreed with @NZKoz then, and I agree with @NZKoz now.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c151012113"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2771253", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-2771253", "updated_at": "2011-11-17T02:14:48Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhutchin/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhutchin/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhutchin/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhutchin/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhutchin", "login": "mhutchin", "gravatar_id": "73ad07eab73d0bfaae8407926d89a5c4", "html_url": "https://github.com/mhutchin", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhutchin/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhutchin/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhutchin/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/73ad07eab73d0bfaae8407926d89a5c4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F86e78499eeb33fb9cac16b7555b50767.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhutchin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 2162, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mhutchin/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-17T02:14:48Z", "id": 2771253, "owner": "rails"}
