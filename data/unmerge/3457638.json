I totally agree with @jrochkind, it's unfortunate that rails new will not generate a runnable app.  A total newbie's first impression with Rails shouldn't be frustration that it didn't work out of the box when getting up and running quickly has always been a great feature of Rails, especially when the problem can be easily solved and has already been written.  I'm sure once a new user figures out how to add therubyracer to Gemfile, they'll think the same thing I did when this error happened to me, \"Why didn't Rails do this?  It added all of those other gems to the Gemfile\".", "_id": {"$oid": "5238343cbd3543c15100fb23"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3619#issuecomment-3457638"}
