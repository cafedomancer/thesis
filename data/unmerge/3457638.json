I totally agree with @jrochkind, it's unfortunate that rails new will not generate a runnable app.  A total newbie's first impression with Rails shouldn't be frustration that it didn't work out of the box when getting up and running quickly has always been a great feature of Rails, especially when the problem can be easily solved and has already been written.  I'm sure once a new user figures out how to add therubyracer to Gemfile, they'll think the same thing I did when this error happened to me, \"Why didn't Rails do this?  It added all of those other gems to the Gemfile\".", "_id": {"$oid": "5238343cbd3543c15100fb23"}, "issue_id": 3619, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3457638", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3619#issuecomment-3457638", "updated_at": "2012-01-12T02:58:54Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentsowers1/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentsowers1/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentsowers1/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentsowers1/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentsowers1", "login": "brentsowers1", "gravatar_id": "4425fd396ee43b48235575d5a4427409", "html_url": "https://github.com/brentsowers1", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentsowers1/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentsowers1/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentsowers1/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4425fd396ee43b48235575d5a4427409?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F24168baa55bf5e1e69d49638b3cf15ea.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentsowers1/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 218005, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/brentsowers1/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-01-12T02:58:54Z", "id": 3457638, "owner": "rails"}
