Seems like roughly another 4 months are over...\r\n\r\nI am sorry - I don't have the capacity to work on this right now - swamped by RL.\r\n\r\nJust in case - what's the procedure of a \"rebase\"?\r\n\r\nFrom what I understood, the procedure to include changes in master in a pull request goes like this:\r\n- merge my branch locally with master\r\n- push to the same branch on github, which fast-forwards the github branch and also updates the pull request\r\n\r\nIf I instead rebase my local branch on master, I wouldn't be able to push to the same branch on github any more, since it's no longer a fast-forward!? So what do I do after the local rebase?", "_id": {"$oid": "523ec1f2bd354364b9012718"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5476#issuecomment-10475536"}
