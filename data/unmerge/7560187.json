I'm actually OK adding it back as a new feature if we have tests. :-)", "_id": {"$oid": "523e0a74bd354364b900ccfc"}, "issue_id": 7069, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7560187", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7069#issuecomment-7560187", "updated_at": "2012-08-07T17:16:38Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "login": "tenderlove", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-07T17:16:38Z", "id": 7560187, "owner": "rails"}
