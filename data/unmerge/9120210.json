In English, the units of measure usually comes as a `:suffix`, so the word `:prefix` is odd anyway.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f878bd3543c15100b29b"}, "issue_id": 7835, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9120210", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7835#issuecomment-9120210", "updated_at": "2012-10-03T20:07:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum", "login": "yfeldblum", "gravatar_id": "5eadf00e11240f05263ec7735612cd09", "html_url": "https://github.com/yfeldblum", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5eadf00e11240f05263ec7735612cd09?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F485970c473e9165d1649e16c7aa35b83.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 169419, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yfeldblum/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-03T20:07:15Z", "id": 9120210, "owner": "rails"}
