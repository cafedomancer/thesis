Of course the sentence is in books because it is what Rails generates. The point is that **if** we change this, **then** all those books become out of sync in this detail.\r\n\r\nOf course, you evolve a framework on the merits of the changes themselves, books need to adapt to Rails, not Rails to the books. But when you change a literal like this that **implication** has to be taken into account. Often it weights much less than the proposal, but sometimes it weights enough compared to the pros.\r\n\r\nThat linked thread has a few answers by some people. But their answers contradict my Collins dictionary, so I cannot trust them. They are people participating in a thread in Internet. Collins is a reference.\r\n\r\nIn my view we'd no doubt change the sentence **if** it was incorrect. But if it cannot be said that it is incorrect, then taking all the context into account my vote is for doing nothing.\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52503715bd35437be6002087"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12434#issuecomment-25699030"}
