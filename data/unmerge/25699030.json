{"body": "The remark about books is not made to justify the sentence. Of course the sentence is in books because it is what Rails generates. The point is that **if** we change this, **then** all those books become out of sync in this detail.\r\n\r\nOf course, you evolve a framework on the merits of the changes themselves, books need to adapt to Rails, not Rails to the books. But when you change a literal like this that **implication** has to be taken into account. Often it weights much less than the proposal, but sometimes it weights enough compared to the pros.\r\n\r\nThat linked thread has a few answers by some people. But their answers contradict my Collins dictionary, so I cannot trust them. They are people participating in a thread in Internet. Collins is a reference.\r\n\r\nIn my view we'd no doubt change the sentence **if** it was incorrect. But if it cannot be said that it is incorrect, then taking all the context into account my vote is for doing nothing.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/25699030", "created_at": "2013-10-04T13:39:45Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12434#issuecomment-25699030", "updated_at": "2013-10-04T13:41:22Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 12434, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "fxn", "type": "User", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52503715bd35437be6002087"}, "id": 25699030, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/12434"}
