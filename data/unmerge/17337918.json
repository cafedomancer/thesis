Though it evolved as a desire to implement JSON service controllers quickly and easily, the idea is to allow any format, so the name needs to change, eventually. It just requires a module include and then it is a semi-DSL for controller implementation. Basically almost anything that doesn't require much controller tweaking for action methods should work, in theory. And for things that require controller mods, you can override only what you need to in the controller or monkey-patch it.
