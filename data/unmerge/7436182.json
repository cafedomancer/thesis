{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/7168", "repo": "rails", "body": "@stephendavis89 can you sell this idea to me? As a developer with existing rails applications why would I want to switch to using this, and as a developer working on a new rails app why would I want this? Don't just tell me what the change does, but really sell it. Give me full blown user stories. Show me how in your world the pros significantly out weight the cons. If you're going to wait on it, please close the issue. You can always open a new one later, few people go back to look at stale open issues, they just clog up the pipes.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ff4dbd3543c15100bdef"}, "issue_id": 7168, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7436182", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7168#issuecomment-7436182", "updated_at": "2012-08-01T18:48:00Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems", "login": "schneems", "gravatar_id": "db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e", "html_url": "https://github.com/schneems", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/db953d125f5cc49756edb6149f1b813e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6ef42a6eab211ddd71ac423a80b42d15.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 59744, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schneems/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-08-01T18:48:00Z", "id": 7436182, "owner": "rails"}
