{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6824", "repo": "rails", "body": "IMO this doesn't make much semantic sense. Extract means to \"remove or take out\". Adding a \"safe\" version of Hash#extract would be like adding a \"safe\" version of Array#delete.\n\nIf anything, Hash#extract! should have been Hash#extract in the first place. Different people have said different things about the bang vs non-bang semantics, but my favourite version (I think it's from the Eloquent Ruby book) is that bang methods are reserved for a \"dangerous\" (use with caution) version of their non-bang counterpart, like AR#save vs AR#save!. Just because a method does in-place modification doesn't make it bang-worthy - Array#delete, Array#pop etc are all good examples.", "_id": {"$oid": "523803c6bd3543c15100c4ba"}, "issue_id": 6824, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6503075", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6824#issuecomment-6503075", "updated_at": "2012-06-22T08:37:50Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode", "login": "chancancode", "gravatar_id": "22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a", "html_url": "https://github.com/chancancode", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b407b57d02a2e41c7ba54441391d9ce.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 55829, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-06-22T08:37:50Z", "id": 6503075, "owner": "rails"}
