As I told you, I would like to do study more the problem before merging it. Your solution is good but it makes the code too complex (not your fault, that's what happens when you use mutexes).\n\nOn another note, when you want to refactor a pull request, there is no need to close the previous one and create a new one. Simply do a `git push -f`. If you create many pull requests, it gets hard to follow up a discussion.
