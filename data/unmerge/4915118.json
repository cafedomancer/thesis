{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5721", "repo": "rails", "body": "Well I think the idea of changing rails to use an ENV variable was so that heroku didn't have to write out to people's database.yml, they could just set the ENV variable and go.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should raise an exception if *both* are set? (By both I mean, an env variable *and* a configuration in your database.yml for the current environment)  It means that people using heroku would have to rm the `production` section of the database.yml, but maybe that's acceptable.\r\n\r\nWe could also just warn if both are set, and have the ENV configuration win.\r\n\r\nOnly thing that annoys me about both of these solutions (exception or warn) is that in both cases we have to parse the yaml (but I guess we do that anyway).", "_id": {"$oid": "523813aabd3543c15100dadf"}, "issue_id": 5721, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4915118", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5721#issuecomment-4915118", "updated_at": "2012-04-03T17:36:48Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove", "login": "tenderlove", "gravatar_id": "f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea", "html_url": "https://github.com/tenderlove", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f29327647a9cff5c69618bae420792ea?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F7c78335a8924215ea5c22fda1aac7b75.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3124, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-03T17:36:48Z", "id": 4915118, "owner": "rails"}
