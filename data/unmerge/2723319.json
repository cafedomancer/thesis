{"body": "I'm more on @josevalim's suggestion. A nice and meaningful message from ExecJS can be suffice for anyone to decide in which way they want to handle the situation: by putting the gem on Gemfile or installing node. But I see the @guilleiguaran's point of having a working app in no time. I saw myself in that situation a few times on Linux. So, can I suggest something like this in case you go this way:\r\n\r\n    if RUBY_PLATFORM.include? \"linux\"\r\n      # put therubyracer/therubyrhino here\r\n    end\r\n\r\nSo it will not cause the gem to be installed in a Mac when an app has started on a Linux machine without any JS runtime, which could be a quite common scenario.\r\n\r\nA message from ExecJS + the @vijaydev's suggestion of a comment in Gemfile can be nice too. I like this way.\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2723319", "created_at": "2011-11-13T17:27:53Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3619#issuecomment-2723319", "updated_at": "2011-11-13T17:29:35Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 3619, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wsouto/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wsouto/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wsouto/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/wsouto", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wsouto/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/wsouto", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wsouto/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e2d8c6474e9bca14427df43c90d4ef1b?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fd16410dee0bd247ad13e04d31ee2a1a4.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wsouto/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wsouto/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e2d8c6474e9bca14427df43c90d4ef1b", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wsouto/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "wsouto", "type": "User", "id": 357932, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/wsouto/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238343cbd3543c15100fb18"}, "id": 2723319, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/3619"}
