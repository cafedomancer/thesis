There are weird inflections, we have a method to fix them, and it's just not that big a deal.  Remember that in addition to annoying arguments, there are some inflections which aren't possible to determine correctly (e.g. index->indices or indexes depends on which index you mean).\n\nIf we generate a huge initializer who's life are we improving?  People will still be locked with the inflections at the time they generated the app.  All we're doing is opening up an area for discussions and maintenance pain.\n", "_id": {"$oid": "52380016bd3543c15100bf3e"}, "issue_id": 7071, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7053332", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7071#issuecomment-7053332", "updated_at": "2012-07-18T00:11:46Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz", "login": "NZKoz", "gravatar_id": "efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425", "html_url": "https://github.com/NZKoz", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/efa76b164a7de4a5730e4fa397cc4425?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 197, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/NZKoz/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-07-18T00:08:28Z", "id": 7053332, "owner": "rails"}
