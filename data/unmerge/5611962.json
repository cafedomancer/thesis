Engines can be either external gems or internal \"apps\". In case of internal apps, I would like a `Gemfile.lock` in the same way I have for my apps.\r\n\r\nEven if it was external, I don't agree with Yehuda's blog post that open source projects shouldn't have a `Gemfile.lock`. Having everyone running your project using different versions can make it very hard to reproduce issues. YMMV. :)", "_id": {"$oid": "52380c52bd3543c15100d138"}, "issue_id": 6234, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5611962", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6234#issuecomment-5611962", "updated_at": "2012-05-09T21:17:04Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-09T21:13:56Z", "id": 5611962, "owner": "rails"}
