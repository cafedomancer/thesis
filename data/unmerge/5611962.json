In case of internal apps, I would like a `Gemfile.lock` in the same way I have for my apps.\r\n\r\nEven if it was external, I don't agree with Yehuda's blog post that open source projects shouldn't have a `Gemfile.lock`. Having everyone running your project using different versions can make it very hard to reproduce issues.
