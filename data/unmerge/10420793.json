Having a URL with entities not escaped looks suspicious to me, it means someone didn't decode the entities in some format to yield the actual data string.\r\n\r\nNot sure this patch should be applied, don't see a use case at first sight that justifies it, but please let me know if I am missing something.\r\n\r\n(Editorial note: \"HTML\" is all uppercase.)", "_id": {"$oid": "523da1c1bd354364b90087dd"}, "issue_id": 8228, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10420793", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8228#issuecomment-10420793", "updated_at": "2012-11-15T19:05:59Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-15T19:05:18Z", "id": 10420793, "owner": "rails"}
