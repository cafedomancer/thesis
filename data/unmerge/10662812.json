{"body": "@nikitug It's a good point that you raised about clashes between a potential `Array#foo` and `@klass.foo` method. It's not really a thread safety issue, but an issue nonetheless. Unfortunately adding extra checking to the compiled method will make it much slower, in which case there's a lot less point having the compiled method at all.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about an entirely different solution to address this category of problem - see #8300.
