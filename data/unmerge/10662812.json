{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8127", "repo": "rails", "body": "@nikitug It's a good point that you raised about clashes between a potential `Array#foo` and `@klass.foo` method. It's not really a thread safety issue, but an issue nonetheless. Unfortunately adding extra checking to the compiled method will make it much slower, in which case there's a lot less point having the compiled method at all.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about an entirely different solution to address this category of problem - see #8300. I'd like to wait and get others' feedback before deciding how to proceed with this issue.", "_id": {"$oid": "523da7aebd354364b9008cbb"}, "issue_id": 8127, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10662812", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8127#issuecomment-10662812", "updated_at": "2012-11-23T15:35:23Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "login": "jonleighton", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-23T15:35:23Z", "id": 10662812, "owner": "rails"}
