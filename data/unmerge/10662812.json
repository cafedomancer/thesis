It's not really a thread safety issue, but an issue nonetheless. Unfortunately adding extra checking to the compiled method will make it much slower, in which case there's a lot less point having the compiled method at all.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about an entirely different solution to address this category of problem - see #8300. I'd like to wait and get others' feedback before deciding how to proceed with this issue.", "_id": {"$oid": "523da7aebd354364b9008cbb"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8127#issuecomment-10662812"}
