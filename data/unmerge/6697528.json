{"body": "Have not been able to review the change, but one note on the ConcurrentHashMap impl of the cache: we will not want to go with the defaults for concurrency level because CHM defaults to 16-way concurrency and ends up very large in memory to guarantee that. I'm not sure if this is a tunable that should be surfaced in Rails or if we should just pick a reasonable default for how heavily-hit each caching structure will be (e.g. some caches are unlikely to contend, others will be heavily contended).\n\nDefinitely will want to look at memory comparisons before/after patch on JRuby.\n\nMore to come...going to chat with @tenderlove tomorrow about this. If you can be on IRC tomorrow, @thedarkone, would be good to catch up on this.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6697528", "created_at": "2012-07-01T22:13:53Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6917#issuecomment-6697528", "updated_at": "2012-07-01T22:13:53Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6917, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/headius", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/f1d37642fdaa1662ff46e4c65731e9ab?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F36bedb6eb7152f39b16328448942822b.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/received_events", "gravatar_id": "f1d37642fdaa1662ff46e4c65731e9ab", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "headius", "type": "User", "id": 10135, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/headius/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523801f5bd3543c15100c22d"}, "id": 6697528, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6917"}
