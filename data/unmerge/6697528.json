I'm not sure if this is a tunable that should be surfaced in Rails or if we should just pick a reasonable default for how heavily-hit each caching structure will be (e.g. some caches are unlikely to contend, others will be heavily contended).\n\nDefinitely will want to look at memory comparisons before/after patch on JRuby.\n\nMore to come...going to chat with @tenderlove tomorrow about this. If you can be on IRC tomorrow, @thedarkone, would be good to catch up on this.", "_id": {"$oid": "523801f5bd3543c15100c22d"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6917#issuecomment-6697528"}
