The code had a bug, that is a fact you should not take that as an offense to the OP.\r\n\r\nI clearly stated that I totally respected that people participating in the thread could have a different point of view about what they prefer to return from predicates. But they do not mandate how Ruby works. They would like Ruby to be like Java. No problem, but it isn't.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I respect other opinions does not mean I am going to apply the patch or to change the project policy about predicates. Why, because I do not agree with those opinions, and this is my code base. I am not going to your projects to tell you how to write *your* predicates to match *my* preferences.\r\n\r\nI didn't revert for the sake of winning the argument. I explained the reasons the patch was reverted in the commit message.\r\n\r\n@vertis if you calm down and read the thread cold a week later, you'll see you are not being objective in your judgements.", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd40"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4707855"}
