{"body": "After reading the spec again, I'm indifferent about what is more \"correct\" here. It looks like it will be 3DP everywhere in Rails 4.1 to unify the difference (easy points for a PR? ;).\r\n\r\nSo, if you need to support old clients, as suggested by Jeremy, this is a patch that might help:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# config/initializers/custom_json_time_format.rb\r\n[Date, DateTime, Time, ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone].each do |klass|\r\n  klass.class_eval do\r\n    def as_json(*)\r\n      xmlschema(0)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifying all the date classes and and explicit 0 precision should future-proof against changes here. You probably want to test this code yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/24433600", "created_at": "2013-09-14T00:54:03Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12226#issuecomment-24433600", "updated_at": "2013-09-14T00:54:03Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 12226, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/chancancode", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b407b57d02a2e41c7ba54441391d9ce.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/received_events", "gravatar_id": "22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "chancancode", "type": "User", "id": 55829, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cdbabd3543c1510079c9"}, "id": 24433600, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/12226"}
