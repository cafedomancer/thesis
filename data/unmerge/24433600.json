It looks like it will be 3DP everywhere in Rails 4.1 to unify the difference (easy points for a PR? ;).\r\n\r\nSo, if you need to support old clients, as suggested by Jeremy, this is a patch that might help:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# config/initializers/custom_json_time_format.rb\r\n[Date, DateTime, Time, ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone].each do |klass|\r\n  klass.class_eval do\r\n    def as_json(*)\r\n      xmlschema(0)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifying all the date classes and and explicit 0 precision should future-proof against changes here. You probably want to test this code yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "_id": {"$oid": "5237cdbabd3543c1510079c9"}, "issue_id": 12226, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/24433600", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12226#issuecomment-24433600", "updated_at": "2013-09-14T00:54:03Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode", "login": "chancancode", "gravatar_id": "22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a", "html_url": "https://github.com/chancancode", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b407b57d02a2e41c7ba54441391d9ce.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 55829, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-09-14T00:54:03Z", "id": 24433600, "owner": "rails"}
