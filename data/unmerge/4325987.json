There is no need to backport to 3.1 nor 3.2 since this would be a new feature.\r\n\r\nBut first I would like your feedback in one thing. The way I currently approach this problem is that I add `MyEngine::Engine.load_seed` inside my application db/seeds.rb. This allows the application to control exactly what it wants to include and everything is still encapsulated inside `rake db:seed`. What do you think of this approach?\r\n\r\nThanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "52381a49bd3543c15100e2ea"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5284#issuecomment-4325987"}
