{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5284", "repo": "rails", "body": "Hey man, I hope you are doing great. There is no need to backport to 3.1 nor 3.2 since this would be a new feature.\r\n\r\nBut first I would like your feedback in one thing. The way I currently approach this problem is that I add `MyEngine::Engine.load_seed` inside my application db/seeds.rb. This allows the application to control exactly what it wants to include and everything is still encapsulated inside `rake db:seed`. What do you think of this approach?\r\n\r\nThanks!", "_id": {"$oid": "52381a49bd3543c15100e2ea"}, "issue_id": 5284, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4325987", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5284#issuecomment-4325987", "updated_at": "2012-03-05T16:28:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-05T16:28:12Z", "id": 4325987, "owner": "rails"}
