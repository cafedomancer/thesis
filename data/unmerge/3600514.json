Ideally I guess you'd check for all such scenarios before building the query, but that can make the code so much more complex. \r\n\r\nI really like the idea of a scoped .none for this situation, that just returns an empty record set. It's cheaper and cleaner than firing the query to the database.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238246ebd3543c15100ec19"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4548#issuecomment-3600514"}
