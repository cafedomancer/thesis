Ideally I guess you'd check for all such scenarios before building the query, but that can make the code so much more complex. \r\n\r\nI really like the idea of a scoped .none for this situation, that just returns an empty record set. It's cheaper and cleaner than firing the query to the database.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238246ebd3543c15100ec19"}, "issue_id": 4548, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3600514", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4548#issuecomment-3600514", "updated_at": "2012-01-22T01:37:59Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iHiD/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iHiD/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iHiD/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iHiD/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/iHiD", "login": "iHiD", "gravatar_id": "955103d80e386882143a78875fb727bf", "html_url": "https://github.com/iHiD", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iHiD/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iHiD/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iHiD/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/955103d80e386882143a78875fb727bf?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F66a04212026e6c48b31b7a1e06c1c597.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iHiD/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 286476, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iHiD/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-01-22T01:37:59Z", "id": 3600514, "owner": "rails"}
