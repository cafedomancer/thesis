{"body": "@ryanb I chose `pages` because it can be pluralized with no problems (welcomes?) and is agnostic in meaning. It also played nice with this sister pull request #7772 and could give a default place for `about/privacy/etc.` (as opposed to welcomes/about, homes/privacy).\n\n```ruby\n1.9.3dev :001 > \"welcome\".pluralize\n => \"welcomes\" \n1.9.3dev :002 > \"home\".pluralize\n => \"homes\" \n1.9.3dev :003 > \"page\".pluralize\n => \"pages\" \n```\n\n At the end of the day i'm impartial to the naming as long as we get rid of `public/index.html` :) We can also kill the show action if desired, thought it would be nice to show potential implementation, instead of making a separate controller for \"static-ish\" pages.
