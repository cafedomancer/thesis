The attitude portrayed throughout the original pull request was one of a dictator not a collaborator. Lets recap:\r\n  - A user came with a problem, resulting in a change from 2.3 to 3.x.\r\n  - The user was dismissed and insulted as having his code wrong, despite the fact that it is an accepted practice to return singletons from predicate (?) methods. One doesn't have to look very far in Ruby core to find that the majority of the methods work this way.\r\n  - When there was broad support for reverting this method to the previous way of working, @fxn objected for the sake of clarity(?), and later for not wanting to create the impression that they can be relied on to return singletons. \r\n  - When a subsequent patch was applied by another core team member, he reverted a perfectly good commit for the sake of winning the argument. In doing so he stated that if it had been done with performance as the message he would have been fine with it.\r\n\r\nSo here we are.", "_id": {"$oid": "523815a3bd3543c15100dd3f"}, "issue_id": 5580, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4707648", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5580#issuecomment-4707648", "updated_at": "2012-03-27T00:42:15Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis", "login": "vertis", "gravatar_id": "b2a9e57c2a8ed757833b4c787b6c51d5", "html_url": "https://github.com/vertis", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/b2a9e57c2a8ed757833b4c787b6c51d5?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84e17d99a1e885b374d0cb2e25d7aa4b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 19705, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vertis/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-27T00:42:15Z", "id": 4707648, "owner": "rails"}
