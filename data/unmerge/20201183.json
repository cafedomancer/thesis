Decide if rails should require the extracted gem as a dependency or development dependency.  Either way, this PR depends on having satisfactorily completed the gem\r\n2. I need some eyes on the gem. I'm newish at rails plugins and know there's something wrong with the rake test..\r\n  1. Additionally, I decided to namespace the gem's task to `rake code_metrics:stats` to differentiate it. Do you agree with that naming?\r\n  2. I exposed the stats and profile tasks as executables named `code_metrics` and `code_metrics-profile`. Do you agree with that naming?\r\n  3. Will someone then fork the gem into the rails organization?  Will I have commit access to that?\r\n  4. Once the gem is released, I can include the request profiler code in `tools/profile`, and if desired, include using it in the `rake lines` task where I've removed the code. Are those both desired?\r\n  5. Should this commit add the completed gem as a development dependency to the rails gemspec?\r\n  6.
