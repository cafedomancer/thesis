What if you have two passwords for a user for 2 different systems? I guess you could store in two different fields but has_secure :password and has_secure :some_api_key makes a lot more sense, has_secure_password :some_api_key seems a bit sloppy. Storing other sensitive information is also a common use case that I think we might as well reuse this functionality for.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385c96bd3543c151011f35"}, "issue_id": 1159, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1250097", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1159#issuecomment-1250097", "updated_at": "2011-05-27T16:41:24Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nickhammond/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nickhammond/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nickhammond/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nickhammond/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/nickhammond", "login": "nickhammond", "gravatar_id": "f625094ab6b81fc89f831ce8bcdbf6a0", "html_url": "https://github.com/nickhammond", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nickhammond/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nickhammond/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nickhammond/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f625094ab6b81fc89f831ce8bcdbf6a0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc7f746b7939ba6db31093d4438d9207b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nickhammond/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 17698, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/nickhammond/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-05-27T16:41:24Z", "id": 1250097, "owner": "rails"}
