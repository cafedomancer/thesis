What if you have two passwords for a user for 2 different systems? I guess you could store in two different fields but has_secure :password and has_secure :some_api_key makes a lot more sense, has_secure_password :some_api_key seems a bit sloppy. Storing other sensitive information is also a common use case that I think we might as well reuse this functionality for.", "_id": {"$oid": "52385c96bd3543c151011f35"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/1159#issuecomment-1250097"}
