That's perfect.\r\n\r\nBut the fact is that Ruby the programming language has clear rules about this. As most programming languages out there.\r\n\r\n> Predicates typically return one of the Boolean values true or false, but this is not required, as any value other than false or nil works like true when a Boolean value is required. (The Numeric method nonzero?, for example, returns nil if the number it is invoked on is zero, and just returns the number otherwise.)\r\n\r\nThat's from Flanagan & Matz.\r\n\r\nThus, while you may have personal preferences and reflect them on your code, when your code is **client** code you cannot expect anything particular from a predicate unless documented.\r\n\r\nThat's the way the language works.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e207"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4669464", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4669464", "updated_at": "2012-03-23T22:57:28Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "login": "fxn", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-23T22:56:36Z", "id": 4669464, "owner": "rails"}
