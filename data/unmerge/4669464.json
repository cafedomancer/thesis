That's perfect.\r\n\r\nBut the fact is that Ruby the programming language has clear rules about this. As most programming languages out there.\r\n\r\n> Predicates typically return one of the Boolean values true or false, but this is not required, as any value other than false or nil works like true when a Boolean value is required. (The Numeric method nonzero?, for example, returns nil if the number it is invoked on is zero, and just returns the number otherwise.)\r\n\r\nThat's from Flanagan & Matz.\r\n\r\nThus, while you may have personal preferences and reflect them on your code, when your code is **client** code you cannot expect anything particular from a predicate unless documented.\r\n\r\nThat's the way the language works.", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e207"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4669464"}
