It was a year ago, fuzzy memory. :p We were consuming our own API but not for authentication.\n\nIf I recall, we had both API authentication and web authentication. The API authentication worked over HTTPS so that tacks on even more overhead to each request. I think we would have been fine with a reduced cost for the sake of keeping the same model for both authentication schemes. As I pointed out earlier, even a cost of 2 for BCrypt is still stronger than SHA512.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238635abd3543c1510124b7"}, "issue_id": 285, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1017290", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/285#issuecomment-1017290", "updated_at": "2011-04-17T17:16:32Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella", "login": "bcardarella", "gravatar_id": "ed5f3e2d77dcf44a67efa72e09e9f28f", "html_url": "https://github.com/bcardarella", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ed5f3e2d77dcf44a67efa72e09e9f28f?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F47fa1e27cc0c050aaf8f02272045eca0.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 18524, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bcardarella/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-04-17T17:14:06Z", "id": 1017290, "owner": "rails"}
