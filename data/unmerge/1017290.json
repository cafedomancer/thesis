It was a year ago, fuzzy memory. :p We were consuming our own API but not for authentication.\n\nIf I recall, we had both API authentication and web authentication. The API authentication worked over HTTPS so that tacks on even more overhead to each request. I think we would have been fine with a reduced cost for the sake of keeping the same model for both authentication schemes. As I pointed out earlier, even a cost of 2 for BCrypt is still stronger than SHA512.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238635abd3543c1510124b7"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/285#issuecomment-1017290"}
