{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8408", "repo": "rails", "body": "@yfeldblum I absolutely agree with you. \r\n\r\nWhat I want to work through to solve is setting the cost to a value where the value was based off the #calibrate method. It is not my intention to do something like this: `ActiveModel::SecurePassword.cost = BCrypt::Engine.calibrate(200)`.\r\n\r\nI still think you should be able to set the #cost explicitly. However, I think when adding this to Rails it needs to provide a bit more guidance on how to set the cost instead of just assigning it an arbitrary integer - which I mistakenly did. \r\n\r\nThat's why I like the idea of using the `#calibrate` method from BCrypt to either be part of the docs or to be \"something\" that the developer could use to determine a desirable cost. \r\n\r\nI'm just not sure what the interface should look like while making it simple for a developer to use. I figured I'd go play around with that in a Gem first. :)", "_id": {"$oid": "523d9148bd354364b9007dfa"}, "issue_id": 8408, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/11008435", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8408#issuecomment-11008435", "updated_at": "2012-12-04T18:19:05Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/revans/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/revans/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/revans/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/revans/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/revans", "login": "revans", "gravatar_id": "bc5fbb4a793359c2c527e37edfa470a2", "html_url": "https://github.com/revans", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/revans/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/revans/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/revans/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/bc5fbb4a793359c2c527e37edfa470a2?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F28f0b864598a1291557bed248a998d4e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/revans/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 394, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/revans/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-12-04T18:19:05Z", "id": 11008435, "owner": "rails"}
