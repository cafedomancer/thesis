It is not my intention to do something like this: `ActiveModel::SecurePassword.cost = BCrypt::Engine.calibrate(200)`.\r\n\r\nI still think you should be able to set the #cost explicitly. However, I think when adding this to Rails it needs to provide a bit more guidance on how to set the cost instead of just assigning it an arbitrary integer - which I mistakenly did. \r\n\r\nThat's why I like the idea of using the `#calibrate` method from BCrypt to either be part of the docs or to be \"something\" that the developer could use to determine a desirable cost. \r\n\r\nI'm just not sure what the interface should look like while making it simple for a developer to use. I figured I'd go play around with that in a Gem first. :)", "_id": {"$oid": "523d9148bd354364b9007dfa"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8408#issuecomment-11008435"}
