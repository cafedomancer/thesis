I would just add the following changes (but I can do it myself in later commits after this is merged, this is more of a mental note):\r\n\r\n1) We could move `config.action_view.default_method_for_update` to `config.default_method_for_update` so other frameworks can read it as well (see 2 below);\r\n\r\n2) There is no need to generate routes for both PUT and PATCH. We could read the config in 1) and generate just one of the routes;\r\n\r\n3) `config.default_method_for_update` should be uncommented in new applications as we already changed all docs", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c1510120f3"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-2722174"}
