I would just add the following changes (but I can do it myself in later commits after this is merged, this is more of a mental note):\r\n\r\n1) We could move `config.action_view.default_method_for_update` to `config.default_method_for_update` so other frameworks can read it as well (see 2 below);\r\n\r\n2) There is no need to generate routes for both PUT and PATCH. We could read the config in 1) and generate just one of the routes;\r\n\r\n3) `config.default_method_for_update` should be uncommented in new applications as we already changed all docs", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c1510120f3"}, "issue_id": 505, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2722174", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-2722174", "updated_at": "2011-11-13T13:07:26Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2011-11-13T13:07:01Z", "id": 2722174, "owner": "rails"}
