I guess that the *best* fix would be to fix replace to set correctly ordered target (now, return value can either be consistent with what user passes or with actual new target). So replace would work like:\n\n```\npost.comments = [c1, c2]\npost.comments.replace [c3, c1] # => [c3, c1]\npost.comments # => [c3, c1]\n```\n\n/cc @steveklabnik ", "_id": {"$oid": "52380c50bd3543c15100d131"}, "issue_id": 6237, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5794234", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6237#issuecomment-5794234", "updated_at": "2012-05-18T19:56:34Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus", "login": "drogus", "gravatar_id": "582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30", "html_url": "https://github.com/drogus", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/582034b63279abeaa8e76acf12f5ee30?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3202111cf90e7c816a472aaceb72b0df.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 5004, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/drogus/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-18T19:56:34Z", "id": 5794234, "owner": "rails"}
