{"body": "However, we need to make sure people who uses this understands that this is only as reliable as the infector itself. Edge cases that would normally break the infector would break this also. (Couldn't think of any off the top of my head, most infector \"bugs\" are around x.pluralize.singularize != x, or the other way around.)\n\nThe implications are:\n\n1. If this doesn't work for you, you would have to fix it yourself by adding your own infector rule. [Unless your problem affects > 50K users. See #2457 ;) ]\n\n2. This really isn't meant for general purpose use cases (validating user input), because it is not guaranteed that it would work correctly on arbitrary input. Just like the infector itself, it's really designed for things like Rails model names - a limited set of things in your code that you have control over, so that when things do not work the way you expected you can add custom inflector rules to address the problem.\n\nEdit:\n\nFinally I have an example \"edge case\" for you:\n\n```ruby\n>> 'bonus'.singularize == 'bonus'\n=> false\n```\n\nThis proves my point that people should not expect this to work for arbitrary input. If you try, you definitely will run into problems very quickly.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/6477310", "created_at": "2012-06-21T08:50:17Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6802#issuecomment-6477310", "updated_at": "2012-06-21T10:04:04Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6802, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/chancancode", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8b407b57d02a2e41c7ba54441391d9ce.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/received_events", "gravatar_id": "22bb3e56828870ee9a0dd93aeadbe04a", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "chancancode", "type": "User", "id": 55829, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chancancode/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e2563bd354364b900ddcc"}, "id": 6477310, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6802"}
