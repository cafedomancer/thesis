{"body": "@steveklabnik As you say RFC2068 has been obsoleted by RFC2616. http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068\r\n\r\nRFC2616, a draft standard, doesn't include a definition of PATCH. All it has to say is *The PATCH, LINK, UNLINK methods were defined but not commonly implemented in previous versions of this specification. See RFC 2068 [33].* To me this doesn't say that PATCH is a part of HTTP 1.1. Also the [proposed standard for PATCH](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) (not a draft standard) doesn't include any of the authors of RFC2616 in its list of authors, and I couldn't find any endorsement for RFC5789 from Fielding online.\r\n\r\nSo PATCH feels pretty random to me. Much more random than semantically replacing a document with an updated version but leaving created_at, updated_at, and id intact, and maybe omitting some unchanged fields for efficiency.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3148453", "created_at": "2011-12-14T20:26:10Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3148453", "updated_at": "2011-12-14T20:27:35Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 505, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/benatkin", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/70b0265140eaff6e312eb3efcff3c195?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F84f74ce4511e0c9531af1182fb636f0f.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/received_events", "gravatar_id": "70b0265140eaff6e312eb3efcff3c195", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "benatkin", "type": "User", "id": 4126, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/benatkin/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c15101211d"}, "id": 3148453, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/505"}
