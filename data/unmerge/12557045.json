I even thought about doing gem releases, but don't know how much trouble it'll be given that we need to do all six gems under different names. I started by cherry-picking @johndouthat's gemspecs into the organization repo so you can do:\r\n\r\n```rb\r\ngit 'git://github.com/rails2/rails.git', :branch => '2-3-stable' do\r\n  gem 'rails'\r\n  gem 'actionmailer'\r\n  gem 'actionpack'\r\n  gem 'activerecord'\r\n  gem 'activeresource'\r\n  gem 'activesupport'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works, but it sucks. The monolithic Rails repo is huge, so now `bundle` takes way longer than I'd like. At least we're safe(r) and avoid vendoring the whole thing.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ee64bd3543c151009f7b"}, "issue_id": 8948, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/12557045", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8948#issuecomment-12557045", "updated_at": "2013-01-22T17:57:34Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjohansen/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjohansen/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjohansen/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjohansen/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjohansen", "login": "cjohansen", "gravatar_id": "6e7ddb6784d284c385f3f0f307ebf90d", "html_url": "https://github.com/cjohansen", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjohansen/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjohansen/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjohansen/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/6e7ddb6784d284c385f3f0f307ebf90d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F0ddb0ca1ac0fe9a9899a14c8da505d02.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjohansen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 32871, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cjohansen/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-01-22T17:57:01Z", "id": 12557045, "owner": "rails"}
