I even thought about doing gem releases, but don't know how much trouble it'll be given that we need to do all six gems under different names. I started by cherry-picking @johndouthat's gemspecs into the organization repo so you can do:\r\n\r\n```rb\r\ngit 'git://github.com/rails2/rails.git', :branch => '2-3-stable' do\r\n  gem 'rails'\r\n  gem 'actionmailer'\r\n  gem 'actionpack'\r\n  gem 'activerecord'\r\n  gem 'activeresource'\r\n  gem 'activesupport'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works, but it sucks. The monolithic Rails repo is huge, so now `bundle` takes way longer than I'd like. At least we're safe(r) and avoid vendoring the whole thing.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ee64bd3543c151009f7b"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8948#issuecomment-12557045"}
