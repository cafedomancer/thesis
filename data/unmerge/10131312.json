The existing tests for `#to_yaml` didn't pass under Ruby 1.9.3 (because `TimeWithZone#to_yaml` delegates to `Time#to_yaml`, and the format returned by `Time#to_yaml` varies between Ruby implementations), so I tweaked them to make them implementation-agnostic.\r\n\r\nI noticed that a bunch of the unit tests are failing, so I made a fix to MissingSourceFile, and fixed a bug in one of the I18n tests. The remaining failures are mostly from NokogiriSAXEngineTest.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f5aabd3543c15100ac82"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8134#issuecomment-10131312"}
