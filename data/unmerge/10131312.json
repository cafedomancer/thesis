{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/8134", "repo": "rails", "body": "I added a test to verify that `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone` can be serialized/deserialized to/from YAML. The existing tests for `#to_yaml` didn't pass under Ruby 1.9.3 (because `TimeWithZone#to_yaml` delegates to `Time#to_yaml`, and the format returned by `Time#to_yaml` varies between Ruby implementations), so I tweaked them to make them implementation-agnostic.\r\n\r\nI noticed that a bunch of the unit tests are failing, so I made a fix to MissingSourceFile, and fixed a bug in one of the I18n tests. The remaining failures are mostly from NokogiriSAXEngineTest.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f5aabd3543c15100ac82"}, "issue_id": 8134, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/10131312", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8134#issuecomment-10131312", "updated_at": "2012-11-06T22:51:20Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexdowad/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexdowad/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexdowad/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexdowad/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexdowad", "login": "alexdowad", "gravatar_id": "5dbfc386f986b9d600324cd02dae266d", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexdowad", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexdowad/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexdowad/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexdowad/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/5dbfc386f986b9d600324cd02dae266d?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F9a2d76c7d76ca4aa90d8036603f0586b.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexdowad/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 1067359, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexdowad/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-11-06T22:51:20Z", "id": 10131312, "owner": "rails"}
