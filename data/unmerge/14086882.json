{"body": "@NZKoz @homakov I'm not sure I understand what is being discussed here, but this PR is simply to update the docs slight to be accurate with regards to current behaviour.\r\n\r\nI know, for example, that AngularJS (http://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq) directly supports taking a CSRF token from a cookie and then sending it back in subsequent requests as a header value. Since a CSRF attack can't replicate this it avoids hijacking the session to submit to the API the same as for a standard form POST. I'm not sure I see the problem. I get that most *public* APIs wouldn't do this, but for people building simple single page apps on the same domain this doesn't seem all that unreasonable.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14086882", "created_at": "2013-02-26T01:11:54Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9405#issuecomment-14086882", "updated_at": "2013-02-26T01:13:12Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 9405, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/chrisnicola", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e2a523100c5d3d437a585962e7cfd625?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F90388c2eb2fb04b5f6aed006b56440a3.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/received_events", "gravatar_id": "e2a523100c5d3d437a585962e7cfd625", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "chrisnicola", "type": "User", "id": 156449, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ea3ebd3543c151009985"}, "id": 14086882, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/9405"}
