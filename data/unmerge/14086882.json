Since a CSRF attack can't replicate this it avoids hijacking the session to submit to the API the same as for a standard form POST. I'm not sure I see the problem. I get that most *public* APIs wouldn't do this, but for people building simple single page apps on the same domain this doesn't seem all that unreasonable.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ea3ebd3543c151009985"}, "issue_id": 9405, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/14086882", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9405#issuecomment-14086882", "updated_at": "2013-02-26T01:13:12Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola", "login": "chrisnicola", "gravatar_id": "e2a523100c5d3d437a585962e7cfd625", "html_url": "https://github.com/chrisnicola", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/e2a523100c5d3d437a585962e7cfd625?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F90388c2eb2fb04b5f6aed006b56440a3.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 156449, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chrisnicola/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-02-26T01:11:54Z", "id": 14086882, "owner": "rails"}
