Since a CSRF attack can't replicate this it avoids hijacking the session to submit to the API the same as for a standard form POST. I'm not sure I see the problem. I get that most *public* APIs wouldn't do this, but for people building simple single page apps on the same domain this doesn't seem all that unreasonable.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237ea3ebd3543c151009985"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/9405#issuecomment-14086882"}
