{"body": "Comming back to my original use case: factory like method that ends with `save!`:\nUsing `tap &:save!` solves the problem, but imho makes it a little dirty - minor issue but fix is just one line of code.\n\nI don't see any evil and backward compatibility problems in this patch.\nThe code that relay on `true` as return value would look like:\n\n``` ruby\nif object.save! == true\n```\n\nThis is very likely not going to happen because includes two mistakes in a row.\nAnd as I said returning `self` may be useful.
