{"body": "(With infinite love to @tenderlove).\r\n\r\n@mikekelly Ruby on Rails does not define HTTP semantics, as a web framework it has to provide *means to its users to be able to adhere to them if they want to*, promote proper usage of them, and still allow users to do delete via GET and partial updates via PUT (ie, promoting, not lecturing).\r\n\r\nToday, to toggle the paid flag of an invoice and follow proper HTTP semantics, you have to make that flag a resource. That's for me a conclusion of this thread, based on quotes from Roy Fielding.\r\n\r\nSo the topic of the thread is: *given* these definitions, what should Rails do next? Perhaps the answer is PATCH, or perhaps is nothing, we still don't know.\r\n\r\nAnd if Rails had some sort of support for PATCH, you still would not be able to do idempotent partial updates and adhere to HTTP semantics at the same time. That's just how things are defined, it's not under the control of Rails. To discuss the convenience of this you need to discuss with the HTTP guys, not the Rails guys.\r\n\r\n", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3193568", "created_at": "2011-12-18T07:16:58Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/505#issuecomment-3193568", "updated_at": "2011-12-18T07:16:58Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 505, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/fxn", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F4a11654ad1e1e48352252859ff3032a0.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/received_events", "gravatar_id": "7223c62b7310e164eb79c740188abbda", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "fxn", "type": "User", "id": 3387, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fxn/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "52385f14bd3543c15101214e"}, "id": 3193568, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/505"}
