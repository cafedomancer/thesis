It may just be that not many people have gone to the bother of requesting it.\n\nIf you re-open this I'll re-apply to master", "_id": {"$oid": "523821c2bd3543c15100e9ee"}, "issue_id": 4759, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5661103", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/4759#issuecomment-5661103", "updated_at": "2012-05-11T20:58:06Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cheerfulstoic/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cheerfulstoic/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cheerfulstoic/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cheerfulstoic/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cheerfulstoic", "login": "cheerfulstoic", "gravatar_id": "1888e77eb90dd84da79b94ce50b6e670", "html_url": "https://github.com/cheerfulstoic", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cheerfulstoic/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cheerfulstoic/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cheerfulstoic/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/1888e77eb90dd84da79b94ce50b6e670?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe87ee55c4373c75c2d6d4f93c507df9a.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cheerfulstoic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 301415, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cheerfulstoic/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-11T20:58:06Z", "id": 5661103, "owner": "rails"}
