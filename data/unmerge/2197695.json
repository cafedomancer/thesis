Rails 2.3.14 introduced a bug, while it fixes security issues. What am I supposed to do? You cannot have a security release, then screw up in a point-release(!!!) and then say you don't want to patch the screw-up.\r\n\r\n2. This is another example of really bad release management. If you want to drop support for a branch that you kept up-to-date, that's fine, I can live with that. But then in projects that have some form of management, they give a deadline after which the support is dropped. You cannot say \"from now on we don't support branch x anymore\". That's just crap.\r\nBut heh, I'm using Rails since version 1.1, so this form of bad release management doesn't actually surprise me... at all.\r\n\r\nOh yeah.. and maybe put on the actual website that you dropped support.
