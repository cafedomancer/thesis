I'm not going to go through that gigantic commit searching for how you implemented this, but my guess is you `split` on `/,\\s+/` and then pluck each argument. This could be a bit simpler, IMO. Why not accept a splatted list of symbols/strings and just let the user pluck however many columns they want in one go? This would prevent you from having to duck type into checking for an array, string, single argument, etc. because it's always an array", "_id": {"$oid": "52381797bd3543c15100df94"}, "issue_id": 5472, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5813831", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5472#issuecomment-5813831", "updated_at": "2012-05-21T00:48:10Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis", "login": "davidcelis", "gravatar_id": "9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9", "html_url": "https://github.com/davidcelis", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9b0144a16ba125a94460c5d45f07efb9?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F3e1a626a9e0c39eb548886c253bf9644.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 36873, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davidcelis/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-05-21T00:40:41Z", "id": 5813831, "owner": "rails"}
