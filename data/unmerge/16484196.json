A railtie is not an engine but it is still generated by rails plugin.\r\n\r\nIn other words, an engine is one specific kind of a rails plugin and the rails plugin command can generate both engines and railties. The old rails plugin *implementation* (the ones inside vendor/plugins) is dead, we still have other kinds of plugins though, it just happens they are packaged differently (through gems, git repos, etc). This naming is by design, after all `rails plugin` was introduced by the time vendor/plugins were becoming irrelevant, soon to be deprecated.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e156bd3543c151008f83"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10244#issuecomment-16484196"}
