{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/10244", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks for the pull request but I don't agree with proposal. A railtie is not an engine but it is still generated by rails plugin.\r\n\r\nIn other words, an engine is one specific kind of a rails plugin and the rails plugin command can generate both engines and railties. The old rails plugin *implementation* (the ones inside vendor/plugins) is dead, we still have other kinds of plugins though, it just happens they are packaged differently (through gems, git repos, etc). This naming is by design, after all `rails plugin` was introduced by the time vendor/plugins were becoming irrelevant, soon to be deprecated.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237e156bd3543c151008f83"}, "issue_id": 10244, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16484196", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/10244#issuecomment-16484196", "updated_at": "2013-04-17T03:21:18Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2013-04-17T02:52:54Z", "id": 16484196, "owner": "rails"}
