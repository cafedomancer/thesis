My motives for this pull request are not to **workaround** heroku limitations, but instead **good defaults**.\r\n\r\nMost PaaS services I've seen are focusing on integration with `rake assets:precompile` as the default.\r\n\r\nSure on some platforms it means simply just changing a rake task that gets executed. On Heroku for example, I'd need to configure all of those apps with custom build packs (not so simple).\r\n\r\nSo, it would be great that this is just handled by a configuration setting in Rails so the only task need run is `rake assets:precompile` in all scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis is also great for extensions to the asset pipeline for example [asset_sync](http://github.com/rumblelabs/asset_sync) where we are now relying on integrating with certain tasks in the pipeline compilation because of how `Kernal.exec` is being used.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion having **one way** of compiling assets makes things a lot simpler (to the end users). As it doesn't matter what my configuration is (wether I use digests or nondigest assets) my deployment processes are still the same.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238191abd3543c15100e128"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5379#issuecomment-4439863"}
