You've had a user complain that a change made things more confusing, and your response is, effectively, \"too bad, that's how it works\". \r\n\r\nThere's no technical argument to be made for that method returning a boolean, but there's also no technical argument to be made for it returning anything else. Given that's the case, why not err on the side of easier to use?\r\n\r\n@tarcieri asked you directly, twice, to address this point, but you haven't done so. Could you please give us a rationale for making a change that increases confusion with no other benefit?", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e243"}, "issue_id": 5329, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4670441", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4670441", "updated_at": "2012-03-24T00:33:35Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bleything/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bleything/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bleything/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bleything/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bleything", "login": "bleything", "gravatar_id": "cd1316e90d3fce59316ae82a4d6f833e", "html_url": "https://github.com/bleything", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bleything/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bleything/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bleything/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cd1316e90d3fce59316ae82a4d6f833e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F39059724f73a9969845dfe4146c5660e.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bleything/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 270, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bleything/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-24T00:33:35Z", "id": 4670441, "owner": "rails"}
