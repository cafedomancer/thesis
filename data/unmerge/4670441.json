You've had a user complain that a change made things more confusing, and your response is, effectively, \"too bad, that's how it works\". \r\n\r\nThere's no technical argument to be made for that method returning a boolean, but there's also no technical argument to be made for it returning anything else. Given that's the case, why not err on the side of easier to use?\r\n\r\n@tarcieri asked you directly, twice, to address this point, but you haven't done so. Could you please give us a rationale for making a change that increases confusion with no other benefit?", "_id": {"$oid": "523819bdbd3543c15100e243"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5329#issuecomment-4670441"}
