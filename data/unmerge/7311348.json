{"body": "@sskirby I think both myself and @tenderlove are not sold on the benefits of IM. and the cost to us of maintaining it within the rails project is quite high. In most cases, I believe that the performance benefits of using IM could also be achieved by structuring the code so that multiple instances of the same record do not get loaded in the first place.\n\nIf it's possible to implement IM separately to AR, then I think those who want IM should develop it as a plugin. I'm sure we'll be happy to consider pull requests which refactor AR internals to enable extension points for this (if those are needed).", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/7311348", "created_at": "2012-07-27T17:38:03Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6524#issuecomment-7311348", "updated_at": "2012-07-27T17:38:03Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 6524, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/jonleighton", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F798cebccb32617ad94123450fd137104.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/received_events", "gravatar_id": "2940bc7d4506f3e099e3dcc32a412b98", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "jonleighton", "type": "User", "id": 1979, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jonleighton/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "523e4e93bd354364b900ee93"}, "id": 7311348, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/6524"}
