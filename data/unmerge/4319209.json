{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5273", "repo": "rails", "body": "Thanks @parndt for your contribution. There are two main concerns here:\r\n\r\n1) `empty?` is not exactly the same as `any?`. `any?` actually iterates over each element of the block and can be considerably slower in these situations. This has already bitten us and for this reason we do not recommend replacing `empty?` by `any?` in Rails code base. I am aware that this example wouldn't expose problems but we avoid doing it regardless because we don't such to become an idiom in Rails;\r\n\r\n2) What Koz tried to say is that we have over 200 pull requests and in general I agree with him that we should avoid sending aesthetic changes to Rails. I agree aesthetics are also important but considering all the work there is to be done, they have low priority. Reviewing a pull request, for smallish that it looks like, takes some time and we have limited resources.\r\n\r\nI hope you understand our concerns and that it doesn't stop you from contributing to Rails as you did many times before.", "_id": {"$oid": "52381a64bd3543c15100e313"}, "issue_id": 5273, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4319209", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5273#issuecomment-4319209", "updated_at": "2012-03-05T09:27:34Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim", "login": "josevalim", "gravatar_id": "e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e", "html_url": "https://github.com/josevalim", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fe20b21ae6508f22fc189c60a0880d0b8.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 9582, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/josevalim/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-03-05T09:27:34Z", "id": 4319209, "owner": "rails"}
