In that case, there would probably be no need to make them optional.\r\n\r\n@davidjrice - I've also released these changes in a gem for Rails 3.2.8, at https://github.com/ndbroadbent/turbo-sprockets-rails3. I would be grateful if you could try it out and let me know if it solves your problem with long deployments.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238191abd3543c15100e144"}, "issue_id": 5379, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9213957", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5379#issuecomment-9213957", "updated_at": "2012-10-07T23:59:51Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent", "login": "ndbroadbent", "gravatar_id": "4931eceec58528529fd004e56af197c4", "html_url": "https://github.com/ndbroadbent", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4931eceec58528529fd004e56af197c4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6c444601992735a1c059ce1fdf1d4587.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 139536, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-10-07T23:59:51Z", "id": 9213957, "owner": "rails"}
