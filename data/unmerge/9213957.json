{"body": "Hi, what do you think about https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/7866 as an alternative solution?\r\n\r\nThis patch means that only digest assets would be compiled, and non-digest assets are generated from those in only a few milliseconds. In that case, there would probably be no need to make them optional.\r\n\r\n@davidjrice - I've also released these changes in a gem for Rails 3.2.8, at https://github.com/ndbroadbent/turbo-sprockets-rails3. I would be grateful if you could try it out and let me know if it solves your problem with long deployments.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/9213957", "created_at": "2012-10-07T23:59:51Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5379#issuecomment-9213957", "updated_at": "2012-10-07T23:59:51Z", "repo": "rails", "issue_id": 5379, "user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/following{/other_user}", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/events{/privacy}", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/orgs", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/gists{/gist_id}", "html_url": "https://github.com/ndbroadbent", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/subscriptions", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/4931eceec58528529fd004e56af197c4?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F6c444601992735a1c059ce1fdf1d4587.png", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/repos", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/received_events", "gravatar_id": "4931eceec58528529fd004e56af197c4", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "login": "ndbroadbent", "type": "User", "id": 139536, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ndbroadbent/followers"}, "owner": "rails", "_id": {"$oid": "5238191abd3543c15100e144"}, "id": 9213957, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5379"}
