In that case, there would probably be no need to make them optional.\r\n\r\n@davidjrice - I've also released these changes in a gem for Rails 3.2.8, at https://github.com/ndbroadbent/turbo-sprockets-rails3. I would be grateful if you could try it out and let me know if it solves your problem with long deployments.", "_id": {"$oid": "5238191abd3543c15100e144"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5379#issuecomment-9213957"}
