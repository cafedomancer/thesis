How would rolling back all changes be a bad thing if the unique index creation has failed. You're assuming it is not important but I find it super important in some cases and I'd really want to rollback everything if it has failed for some reason.\n\nIf you're concerned about \"magically safe\" then tell us an example of when it would not be safe and then add to the docs: \"be aware that this method is not totally safe as ...\"\n\nAlso, you're assuming that most migrations are data changes but in my projects most of them are actually DDL changes.\n\nAlso, there is no point in grouping different migrations in a single one just to be sure they will be run in a single transaction. This is actually a workaround for the current limitation.\n\nPeople voting against this should have a better argument. The ones pointed out simply don't make sense to me.", "_id": {"$oid": "52380449bd3543c15100c595"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/6768#issuecomment-6442424"}
