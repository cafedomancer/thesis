Abandon the idea and forget I ever mentioned it.\r\n\r\n2. Go forward with the idea as an alternative to specifying class_name and the app developer could make the decision about whether to use it, but this might cause support issues for Rails if people decide to use it in all their models.\r\n\r\n3. Try to enhance how const_missing is defined in dependencies.rb and related autoloading such that when it is autoloading a model's class body that contains class references in the class body, those references would not immediately autoload the classes. This would not be very intuitive or Ruby-ish, and I would abandon thinking about it, but it could also be a much better alternative to current autoloading. It could return some sort of flyweight that would load the real class when a method was called on it (via handling by method missing). I don't like the idea of delegating everything called to every autoloaded class through some other class (that would not be efficient and would be problematic), but maybe there is some other way.", "_id": {"$oid": "5237f3e9bd3543c15100a92a"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/8357#issuecomment-10834022"}
