{"issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/5721", "repo": "rails", "body": "I think I prefer dependable precedence (even if it does put `DATABASE_URL` first) to warnings or exceptions. I like the idea that if someone checks in a `database.yml` with dumb defaults, I can just override it with an environment variable. In fact, that more or less addresses my needs, if it also works without `database.yml` present.\r\n\r\nI do worry about the clobbering `DATABASE_URL`'s database when the test suite runs. Maybe I'm just paranoid.\r\n\r\nOne more idea, presumably dismissed but never discussed: What about giving `database.yml` precedence, but falling back to `DATABASE_URL` if it's absent? Then at least Heroku could just delete `database.yml` rather than rewriting it. I don't know. I'd agree it'd be wonderful if Heroku could fully configure your app using environment variables, but I feel like that ship has sailed. (Mind you, I have a wonderfully short-sighted view.)", "_id": {"$oid": "523813aabd3543c15100dae0"}, "issue_id": 5721, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4917767", "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5721#issuecomment-4917767", "updated_at": "2012-04-03T18:13:37Z", "user": {"subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpope/subscriptions", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpope/events{/privacy}", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpope/repos", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpope/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpope", "login": "tpope", "gravatar_id": "67259dd09c53aef920fe2aca18c7a8e0", "html_url": "https://github.com/tpope", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpope/following{/other_user}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpope/received_events", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpope/orgs", "avatar_url": "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/67259dd09c53aef920fe2aca18c7a8e0?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2F8bf1211fd4b7b94528899de0a43b9fb3.png", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpope/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "id": 378, "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tpope/followers", "type": "User"}, "created_at": "2012-04-03T18:12:20Z", "id": 4917767, "owner": "rails"}
