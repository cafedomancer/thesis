I like the idea that if someone checks in a `database.yml` with dumb defaults, I can just override it with an environment variable. In fact, that more or less addresses my needs, if it also works without `database.yml` present.\r\n\r\nI do worry about the clobbering `DATABASE_URL`'s database when the test suite runs. Maybe I'm just paranoid.\r\n\r\nOne more idea, presumably dismissed but never discussed: What about giving `database.yml` precedence, but falling back to `DATABASE_URL` if it's absent? Then at least Heroku could just delete `database.yml` rather than rewriting it. I don't know. I'd agree it'd be wonderful if Heroku could fully configure your app using environment variables, but I feel like that ship has sailed. (Mind you, I have a wonderfully short-sighted view.)", "_id": {"$oid": "523813aabd3543c15100dae0"}, "html_url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5721#issuecomment-4917767"}
